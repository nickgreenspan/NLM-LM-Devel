The Twins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The team is named after the Twin Cities area comprising Minneapolis and St. Paul. They played in Metropolitan Stadium from 1961 to 1981 and the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome from 1982 to 2009. They played their inaugural game at the newly completed Target Field on April 12, 2010. The team was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1901 as one of the eight original teams of the American League, named the Washington Senators or Washington Nationals. Although the Washington team endured long bouts of mediocrity (immortalized in the 1955 Broadway musical Damn Yankees), they had a period of prolonged success in the 1920s and 1930s, led by Baseball Hall of Fame members Bucky Harris, Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Heinie Manush, Joe Cronin, and Walter Johnson. Manager Clark Griffith joined the team in 1912 and became the team's owner in 1920. The franchise remained under Griffith family ownership until 1984. In 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner Calvin Griffith, Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to move his team to Minneapolis-St. Paul and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league approval, the team moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season, setting up shop in Metropolitan Stadium, while Washington fielded a brand new ``Washington Senators'' (which later became the Texas Rangers prior to the 1972 season). Success came quickly to the team in Minnesota. Sluggers Harmon Killebrew and Bob Allison, who had already been stars in Washington, were joined by Tony Oliva and Zoilo Versalles, and later second baseman Rod Carew and pitchers Jim Kaat and Jim Perry, winning the American League pennant in 1965. A second wave of success came in the late 1980s and early 1990s under manager Tom Kelly, led by Kent Hrbek, Bert Blyleven, Frank Viola, and Kirby Puckett, winning the franchise's second and third World Series (and first and second in Minnesota). Through the 2017 season, the franchise has won three World Series championships (1924, 1987, and 1991), and has fielded 18 American League batting champions. The team has hosted five All-Star Games (1937, 1956, 1965, 1985 and 2014).

The Washington Senators spent the first decade of their existence finishing near the bottom of the American League standings. Their fortunes began to improve with the arrival of 19-year-old pitcher, Walter Johnson, in 1907. Johnson blossomed in 1911 with 25 victories, although the Senators still finished the season in seventh place. In 1912, the Senators improved dramatically, as their pitching staff led the league in team earned run average and in strikeouts. Johnson won 33 games while teammate Bob Groom added another 24 wins to help the Senators finish the season in second place. The Senators continued to perform respectably in 1913 with Johnson posting a career-high 35 victories, as the team once again finished in second place. The Senators then fell into another period of decline for the next decade. After a string of mediocre seasons, a rejuvenated Johnson rebounded in 1924 to win 23 games with the help of his catcher, Muddy Ruel, as the Senators won the American League pennant for the first time in the history of the franchise. The Senators faced John McGraw's heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World Series. The two teams traded wins back and forth until the series reached the seventh and deciding game. The Senators trailed the Giants 3 to 1 in the eighth inning of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. An aging Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth inning, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the bottom of the twelfth inning with Ruel at bat, he hit a high, foul ball directly over home plate. The Giants 'catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat. On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and proceeded to score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad hop over Lindstrom's head. This would mark the only World Series triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington. The following season they repeated as American League champions but ultimately lost the 1925 World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates. After Walter Johnson's retirement in 1927, he was hired as manager of the Senators. After enduring a few losing seasons, the team returned to contention in 1930. In 1933, Senators owner Clark Griffith returned to the formula that worked for him nine years prior: 26-year-old shortstop Joe Cronin became player-manager. The Senators posted a 99--53 record and cruised to the pennant seven games ahead of the New York Yankees, but in the 1933 World Series the Giants exacted their revenge winning in five games. Following the loss, the Senators sank all the way to seventh place in 1934 and attendance began to fall. Despite the return of Harris as manager from 1935--42 and again from 1950--54, Washington was mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years contending for the pennant only during World War II. Washington came to be known as ``first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League'', with their hard luck being crucial to the plot of the musical and film Damn Yankees. Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer (1935 A.L. batting champion), Roy Sievers, Mickey Vernon (batting champion in 1946 and 1953), and Eddie Yost were notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of success. In 1954, the Senators signed future Hall of Fame member Harmon Killebrew. By 1959 he was the Senators 'regular third baseman and led the league with 42 home runs earning him a starting spot on the American League All-Star team. President Calvin Coolidge (left) and Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson (right) shake hands following the Senators '1924 championship. After Griffith's death in 1955, his nephew and adopted son Calvin took over the team presidency. Calvin sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and leased it back leading to speculation that the team was planning to move as the Boston Braves, St. Louis Browns and Philadelphia Athletics had all done in the early 1950s. By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the New York Giants would eventually move after that season ended), Griffith began courting Minneapolis--St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities 'first offer before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins. Team nickname (edit) The Washington franchise was known as both ``Senators'' and ``Nationals'' at various times, and sometimes at the same time. In 1905, the team changed its official name to the ``Washington Nationals.'' The name ``Nationals'' appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the ``W'' logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to ``Nats.'' Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the ``Senators'' nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American League team using the ``Nationals'' name. Over time, ``Nationals'' faded as a nickname, and ``Senators'' became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as ``Nationals or Senators'', acknowledging the dual-nickname situation. The team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of Clark Griffith's death. It was not until 1959 that the word ``Senators'' first appeared on team shirts. ``Nats'' continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the 1961 expansion team, which was never officially known as ``Nationals.'' The current ``Nationals'' and ``Nats'' names were revived in 2005, when the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington to become the Nationals. Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present (edit) The name ``Twins'' was derived from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul). The NBA's Minneapolis Lakers had relocated to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul to support the team. Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other, so his desire was to name the team the ``Twin Cities Twins'', however MLB objected. Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins. However, the team was allowed to keep its original ``TC'' (for Twin Cities) insignia for its caps. The team's logo shows two men, one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform, shaking hands across the Mississippi River within an outline of the state of Minnesota. The ``TC'' remained on the Twins 'caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms. By this time, the team felt it was established enough to put an ``M'' on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis. The ``TC'' logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design. Both the ``TC'' and ``Minnie& Paul'' logos remain the team's primary insignia. As of 2010, the ``TC'' logo has been reinstated on the cap as their logo. 1960s (edit) The Twins were eagerly greeted in Minnesota when they arrived in 1961. They brought a nucleus of talented players: Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat, Earl Battey, and Lenny Green. Tony Oliva, who would go on to win American League batting championships in 1964, 1965 and 1971, made his major league debut in 1962. That year, the Twins won 91 games, the most by the franchise since 1933. Behind Mudcat Grant's 21 victories, Versalles 'A.L. MVP season and Oliva's batting title, the Twins won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, but they were defeated in the World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games (behind the Series MVP, Sandy Koufax, who compiled a 2--1 record, including winning the seventh game). Heading into the final weekend of the 1967 season, when Rod Carew was named the A.L. Rookie of the Year, the Twins, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and Detroit Tigers all had a shot at clinching the American League championship. The Twins and the Red Sox started the weekend tied for 1st place and played against each other in Boston for the final three games of the season. The Red Sox won two out of the three games, seizing their first pennant since 1946 with a 92--70 record. The Twins and Tigers both finished one game back, with 91--71 records, while the White Sox finished three games back, at 89--73. In 1969, the new manager of the Twins, Billy Martin, pushed aggressive base running all-around, and Carew set the all-time Major League record by stealing home seven times in addition to winning the first of seven A.L. batting championships. With Killebrew slugging 49 homers and winning the AL MVP Award, these 1969 Twins won the very first American League Western Division Championship, but they lost three straight games to the Baltimore Orioles, winners of 109 games, in the first American League Championship Series. The Orioles would go on to be upset by the New York Mets in the World Series. Martin was fired after the season, in part due to an August 1969 fight in Detroit with 20-game winner Dave Boswell and outfielder Bob Allison, in an alley outside the Lindell A.C. bar. Bill Rigney led the Twins to a repeat division title in 1970, behind the star pitching of Jim Perry (24-12), the A.L. Cy Young Award winner, while the Orioles again won the Eastern Division Championship behind the star pitching of Jim Palmer. Once again, the Orioles won the A.L. Championship Series in a three-game sweep, and this time they would win the World Series. 1970s (edit) After winning the division again in 1970, the team entered an eight-year dry spell, finishing around the. 500 mark. Killebrew departed after 1974. Owner Calvin Griffith faced financial difficulty with the start of free agency, costing the Twins the services of Lyman Bostock and Larry Hisle, who left as free agents after the 1977 season, and Carew, who was traded after the 1978 season. In 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title, having already joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. In 1977, Carew batted. 388, which was the highest in baseball since Boston's Ted Williams hit. 406 in 1941; he won the 1977 AL MVP Award. He won another batting title in 1978, hitting. 333. 1980s--90s (edit) The Metrodome, 2007 In 1982, the Twins moved into the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which they shared with the Minnesota Vikings. After a 16-54 start, the Twins were on the verge on becoming the worst team in MLB history. They turned the season around somewhat, but still lost 102 games which is the second-worst record in Twins history (beaten only by the 2016 team, who lost 103 games), despite the. 301 average, 23 homers and 92 RBI from rookie Kent Hrbek. In 1984, Griffith sold the Twins tomulti-billionaire banker/ financier Carl Pohlad. The Metrodome hosted the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After several losing seasons, the 1987 team, led by Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, Frank Viola (A.L. Cy Young winner in 1988), Bert Blyleven, Jeff Reardon, Tom Brunansky, Dan Gladden, and rising star Kirby Puckett, returned to the World Series after defeating the favored Detroit Tigers in the ALCS, 4 games to 1. Tom Kelly managed the Twins to World Series victories over the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987 and the Atlanta Braves in 1991. The 1988 Twins were the first team in American League history to draw more than 3 million fans. On July 17, 1990, the Twins became the only team in major league history to pull off two triple plays in the same game. Twins 'pitcher and Minnesota native Jack Morris was the star of the series in 1991, going 2--0 in his three starts with a 1.17 ERA. 1991 also marked the first time that any team that finished in last place in their division would advance to the World Series the following season; both the Twins and the Braves did this in 1991. Contributors to the 1991 Twins 'improvement from 74 wins to 95 included Chuck Knoblauch, the A.L. Rookie of the Year; Scott Erickson, 20-game winner; new closer Rick Aguilera and new designated hitter Chili Davis. The World Series in 1991 is regarded by many as one of the classics of all time. In this Series, four games were won during the teams 'final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. The sixth game was a legendary one for Puckett, who tripled in a run, made a sensational leaping catch against the wall, and finally in the 11th inning hit the game-winning home run. The seventh game was tied 0--0 after the regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings. The Twins won on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin in the bottom of the 10th inning, after Morris had pitched ten shutout innings against the Braves. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded as one of the greatest games in the history of professional baseball. After a winning season in 1992 but falling short of Oakland in the division, the Twins fell into a years-long stretch of mediocrity, posting a losing record each season for the next eight: 71--91 in 1993, 50--63 in 1994, 56--88 in 1995, 78--84 in 1996, 68--94 in 1997, 70--92 in 1998, 63--97 in 1999 and 69--93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997, a long sequence of retirements and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins. In 1997, owner Carl Pohlad almost sold the Twins to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont Triad area. Puckett after the 1995 season was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion. The 1989 A.L. batting champion, he retired as the Twins 'all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the time of his retirement, his. 318 career batting average was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record1,000 hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record2,000 hits during his first 10 full calendar years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility. 2000s (edit) Justin Morneau, drafted in 1999 by the Twins, won the AL MVP award in 2006. The Twins dominated the Central Division in the first decade of the new century, winning the division in six of those ten years ('02, '03, '04, '06, '09 and '10), and nearly winning it in '08 as well. From 2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota. Threatened with closure by league contraction, the 2002 team battled back to reach the American League Championship Series before being eliminated 4--1 by that year's World Series champion Anaheim Angels. The Twins have not won a playoff series since the 2002 series against the Athletics, this despite the team winning several division championships in the decade. 2006 (edit) Main article: 2006 Minnesota Twins season In 2006, the Twins won the division on the last day of the regular season (the only day all season they held sole possession of first place) but lost to the Oakland Athletics in the ALDS. Ozzie Guill\u00e9n coined a nickname for this squad, calling the Twins ``little piranhas''. The Twins players embraced the label, and in response, the Twins Front office started a ``Piranha Night'', with piranha finger puppets given out to the first10,000 fans. Scoreboard operators sometimes played an animated sequence of piranhas munching under that caption in situations where the Twins were scoring runs playing ``small ball'', and the stadium vendors sold T-shirts and hats advertising ``The Little Piranhas''. The Twins also had the AL MVP in Justin Morneau, the AL batting champion in Joe Mauer, and the AL Cy Young Award winner in Johan Santana. 2008 (edit) Main article: 2008 Minnesota Twins season In 2008, the Twins finished the regular season tied with the White Sox on top of the AL Central, forcing a one-game playoff in Chicago to determine the division champion. The Twins lost that game and missed the playoffs. The game location was determined by rule of a coin flip that was conducted inmid-September. This rule was changed for the start of the 2009 season, making the site for any tiebreaker game to be determined by the winner of the regular season head-to-head record between the teams involved. 2009 (edit) Main article: 2009 Minnesota Twins season Joe Nathan won the Rolaids Relief Man Award in 2009. After a year where the Twins played. 500 baseball for most of the season, the team won 17 of their last 21 games to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the Central Division. The Twins were able to use the play-in game rule to their advantage when they won the AL Central at the end of the regular season by way of a 6--5 tiebreaker game that concluded with a 12th-inning walk-off hit by Alexi Casilla to right field, that scored Carlos G\u00f3mez. However, they failed to advance to the American League Championship Series as they lost the American League Divisional Series in three straight games to the eventual World Series champion New York Yankees. That year, Joe Mauer became only the second catcher in 33 years to win the AL MVP award. Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez won for the Texas Rangers in 1999, previous to that, the last catcher to win an AL MVP was the New York Yankees Thurman Munson in 1976. Main article: 2010 Minnesota Twins season In their inaugural season played at Target Field, the Twins finished the regular season with a record of 94-68, clinching the AL Central Division title for the 6th time in 9 years under manager Ron Gardenhire. New regular players included rookie Danny Valencia at third base, designated hitter Jim Thome, closer Matt Capps, infielder J.J. Hardy, and infielder Orlando Hudson. In relief pitching roles were late additions Brian Fuentes and Randy Flores. On July 7, the team suffered a major blow when Justin Morneau sustained a concussion, which knocked him out for the rest of the season. In the divisional series, the Twins lost to the Yankees in a three-game sweep for the second consecutive year. Following the season, Ron Gardenhire received AL Manager of the Year honors after finishing as a runner up in several prior years. 2011 (edit) Main article: 2011 Minnesota Twins season After repeating as AL Central champions in 2010, the Twins entered 2011 with no players on the disabled list, and the team seemed poised for another strong season. During the off-season, the team signed Japanese shortstop Tsuyoshi Nishioka to fill a hole in the middle infield,re-signed Jim Thome, who was in pursuit of career home run number 600, and alsore-signed Carl Pavano. However, the season was largely derailed by an extensive list of injuries. Nishioka's broken leg in a collision at second base led the way and was followed by DL stints from Kevin Slowey, Joe Mauer, Jason Repko, Thome, Delmon Young (two stints on the DL), Jos\u00e9 Mijares, Glen Perkins, Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, Jason Kubel, Denard Span (two stints), Justin Morneau, Scott Baker, and Alexi Casilla. The team's low point was arguably on May 1 when the team started 7 players who were batting below. 235 in a game against Kansas City. From that day forward, the Twins made a strong push to get as close as five games back of the division lead by the All-Star break. However, the team struggled down the stretch and fell back out of contention. The team failed to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and experienced their first losing season in four years. Despite an AL-worst 63-99 record, the team drew over 3 million fans for the second consecutive year. Michael Cuddyer served as the Twins representative at the All-Star game, his first appearance. Bert Blyleven's number was retired during the season and he was also inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during the month of July. On August 10, Nathan recorded his 255th save, passing Rick Aguilera for first place on the franchise's all-time saves list. On August 15, Thome hit 599th and 600th home run at Comerica Park to become the eighth player in Major League history to hit 600 home runs, joining Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Alex Rodriguez. 2012--2016 (edit) Main articles: 2012 Minnesota Twins season, 2013 Minnesota Twins season, 2014 Minnesota Twins season, and 2015 Minnesota Twins season The team started the 2012 season with a league worst 10-24 record. In late May and early June, the team embarked on a hot streak, winning ten out of thirteen games. By mid July, the team found themselves only 10 games out of the division lead. On July 16, the Twins defeated the Baltimore Orioles 19-7, the most runs scored in the short history of Target Field. By the end of August, the Twins were more than 20 games below. 500, and last in the American League. On August 29, it was announced that the Twins would host the 2014 All-Star Game. In 2013, the Twins finished in 4th place in the AL Central, with a record of 66-96. In 2014, the team finished with a 70-92 record, last in the division and accumulated the second fewest wins in the American League. As a result, Ron Gardenhire was fired on September 29, 2014. On November 3, 2014 Paul Molitor was announced by the team as the 13th manager in Twins history. In 2015, the team had a winning season (83-79), following four consecutive seasons of 90 or more losses. In 2016, the Minnesota Twins finished last in the AL Central, with a 59-103 record. Brian Dozier set his career high in home runs with 43, which was tied for second in baseball, and leading all 2nd basemen. Tyler Duffey led all Twins starters with 9 wins throughout the season, while fellow reliever Brandon Kintzler led the team with 17 saves. Rising stars Miguel Sano, Max Kepler, and Byron Buxton combined to have 263 total hits, 52 home runs, 167 RBIs, and a batting average of. 232 throughout the season. The Twins signed star Korean slugger Byung Ho Park to a 4-year/$12 million contract, where he hit a. 191 batting average, with 12 home runs, and 24 RBIs before being sent down to Rochester for the remainder of the season. Threatened contraction or relocation of the team (edit) The Metrodome in 2006. The quirks of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, including the turf floor and the white roof, gave the Twins a significant home-field advantage that played into their winning the World Series in both 1987 and 1991, at least in the opinion of their opponents, as the Twins went 12--1 in postseason home games during those two seasons. These were the first two World Series in professional baseball history in which a team won the championship by winning all four home games. (The feat has since been repeated once, by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.) Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, the Greensboro/ Winston-Salem, North Carolina, area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached. Target Field (edit) Main article: Target Field Target Field in 2010. In response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium--a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the Warehouse District of downtown Minneapolis--owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority. Target Field was constructed at a cost of$544.4 million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a$392 million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of$185 million provided by the Pohlad family. As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come. Construction of the new field began in 2007, and was completed in December 2009, in time for the 2010 season. Commissioner Bud Selig, who earlier had threatened to disband the team, observed that without the new stadium the Twins could not have committed to sign their star player, catcher Joe Mauer, to an 8-year,$184 million contract extension. The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the Boston Red Sox on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5--2. On May 18, 2011, Target Field was named ``The Best Place To Shop'' by Street and Smith's SportsBusiness Journal at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City. It was also named ``The Best Sports Stadium in North America'' by ESPN The Magazine in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America. In July 2014, Target Field hosted the 85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the Home Run Derby.

There was no acknowledgment of the Twins 'prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961. Prior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's# 3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's# 29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's# 6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's# 14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's# 34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile were marked on the ``Baggie'' in right field. Harmon Killebrew LF-1B-3B Retired May 4, 1975 Tony Oliva RF-DH-Coach Retired July 14, 1991 Tom Kelly Manager Retired September 8, 2012 Kent Hrbek 1B Retired August 13, 1995 Bert Blyleven Retired July 16, 2011 Rod Carew 1B-2B Retired July 19, 1987 Kirby Puckett CF Retired May 25, 1997 Jackie Robinson All MLB Honored April 15, 1997 Target Field retired number signs in 2010. In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett. The numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins 'executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed. Jackie Robinson's number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997. Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.

With that new network in place the Twins secured a new Metro Affiliate flagship radio station in KSTP (AM 1500). It replaced WCCO (AM 830), which held broadcast rights for the Twins since the team moved to Minneapolis in 1961. For 2013, the Twins moved to FM radio on KTWN-FM 96.3 K-Twin, which is owned by the Pohlad family. The original radio voices of the Twins in 1961 were Ray Scott, Halsey Hall and Bob Wolff. After the first season, Herb Carneal replaced Wolff. Twins TV and radio broadcasts were originally sponsored by the Hamm's Brewing Company. In 2009, Treasure Island Resort& Casino became the first ever naming rights partner for the Twins Radio Network, making the commercial name of TRN the Treasure Island Baseball Network. In 2017, it was announced that WCCO would become the flagship station the Twins again starting in 2018, thus returning the team back to its original station after 11 years. Cory Provus is the current radio play by play announcer, taking over in 2012 for longtime Twins voice John Gordon who retired following the 2011 season. Former Twins OF Dan Gladden serves as color commentator. TRN broadcasts are originated from the studios at Minnesota News Network and Minnesota Farm Networks. Kris Atteberry hosts thepre-game show, the ``Lineup Card'' and the ``Post-game Download'' from those studios except when filling in for Provus or Gladden when they are on vacation. On April 1, 2007, Herb Carneal, the radio voice of the Twins for all but one year of their existence, died at his home in Minnetonka, Minnesota after a long battle with a list of illnesses. Carneal is in the broadcasters wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Hall of Famer Bert Blyleven played 11 seasons for the Twins The television rights are held by Fox Sports North with Dick Bremer as the play-by-play announcer and former Twin, 2011 National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Bert Blyleven as color analyst. They are sometimes joined by Roy Smalley and Jack Morris. Bob Casey was the Twins first public-address announcer starting in 1961 and continuing until his death in 2005. He was well known for his unique delivery and his signature announcements of ``No smoking in the Metrodome, either go outside or quit!'' (or ``go back to Boston'', etc.), ``Batting 3rd, the center-fielder, No. 34, Kirby Puckett!!!'' and asking fans not to 'throw anything or anybody 'onto the field. Community activities (edit) Minnesota Twins Community Fund--Play Ball! Minnesota Team and franchise traditions (edit) Fans wave a Homer Hanky to rally the team during play-offs and other crucial games. The Homer Hanky was created by Terrie Robbins of the Star Tribune newspaper in the Twin Cities in 1987. It was her idea to originally give away60,000 inaugural Homer Hankies. That year, over 2.3 million Homer Hankies were distributed. The party atmosphere of the Twins clubhouse after a win is well-known, the team's players unwinding with loud rock music (usually the choice of the winning pitcher) and video games. The club has several hazing rituals, such as requiring the most junior relief pitcher on the team to carry water and snacks to the bullpen in a brightly colored small child's backpack (Barbie in 2005, SpongeBob SquarePants in 2006, Hello Kitty in 2007, Disney Princess and Tinkerbell in 2009, Chewbacca and Darth Vader in 2010), and many of its players, both past and present, are notorious pranksters. For example, Bert Blyleven earned the nickname ``The Frying Dutchman'' for his ability to pull the ``hotfoot''--which entails crawling under the bench in the dugout and lighting a teammate's shoelaces on fire.

AR-15 style rifles come in many sizes and have many options, depending on the manufacturer. The part shown bottom center is the lower receiver without the receiver extension, rear takedown pin, and buttstock. An AR-15 style rifle is a lightweightsemi-automatic rifle based on the Colt AR-15 design. After Colt's patents expired in 1977, an expanded marketplace emerged with many manufacturers producing their own version of the AR-15 design for commercial sale. They are referred to as modern sporting rifles by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade association, and by some manufacturers. Coverage of high-profile incidents where various versions of the rifle were involved often uses the shorthand AR-15. Since 2010, AR-15 style rifles have become one of the ``most beloved and most vilified rifles'' in the United States, according to the New York Times. It has been promoted as ``America's rifle'' by the National Rifle Association. It has been used in many mass shootings in the United States. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban restricted the Colt AR-15 and derivatives from 1994-2004, although it did not affect rifles with fewer features. There are an estimated 10-12 million in circulation in the United States. Contents (hide) 1 Terminology 2 Modularity 3 Comparison to military versions 4 Production and sales 5 Cartridge variations 6 Use in crime and mass shootings 7 List of models 8 Examples of AR-15 style rifles and carbines 9 See also 10 References 11 Bibliography Terminology 1973 Colt AR-15 SP1 rifle with 'slab side 'lower receiver (lacking raised boss around magazine release button) and original Colt 20-round box magazine In 1956, ArmaLite designed a lightweight assault rifle for military use and designated it the ArmaLite Rifle-15, or AR-15. Due to financial problems, and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity, ArmaLite sold the design and the AR-15 trademark to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959. In 1964, Colt began selling its own version with an improvedsemi-automatic design known as the Colt AR-15. After Colt's patents expired in 1977, an active marketplace emerged for other manufacturers to produce and sell their own AR-15 style rifles. In 2009, the term ``modern sporting rifle'' was coined by the National Shooting Sports Foundation for its survey that year as a marketing term used by the firearms industry to describe modularsemi-automatic rifles including AR-15s. Today, nearly every major firearm manufacturer produces its own generic AR-15 style rifle. As Colt continues to own and use the AR-15 trademark for its line of AR-15 variants, other manufacturers must use their own model numbers and names to market their AR-15 style rifles for commercial sale. Modularity While most earlier breech-loading rifles had a single receiver housing both the trigger and reloading mechanism, an innovative feature of the AR-15 was modular construction to simplify substitution of parts and avoid need for arsenal facilities for most repairs of malfunctioning military rifles. A distinctive two-part receiver is used by both military and sporting AR-15 style rifles. As civilian ownership of AR-15 style rifles became sufficient to create a market for improvements, numerous manufacturers began producing one or more ``improved'' modules, assemblies, or parts with features not found on factory rifles; and individuals with average mechanical aptitude can often substitute these pieces for original equipment. Due to the vast assortment of aftermarket parts and accessories available, AR-15 style rifles have also been referred to as ``the Swiss Army knife of rifles'', ``Barbie Dolls for Guys'' or ``LEGOs'' for adults. These more or less interchangeable modules are a defining characteristic of AR-15 style modern sporting rifles. The lower receiver is the serial-numbered part legally defined as the firearm under United States law. The lower receiver is visually distinguished by the trigger guard ahead of the detachable pistol grip, and behind the magazine well capable of holding detachable magazines. The lower receiver holds the trigger assembly including the hammer, and is the attachment point for the buttstock. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a hinge. The upper receiver contains the bolt carrier assembly, and is attached to the barrel assembly. Sights will be attached to the upper receiver or to the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a gas-operated reloading device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel. The initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting unburned smokeless powder residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the handguard near the barrel port. This piston keeps the receiver cleaner by exhausting under the handguard. While both the DGI and piston systems producesemi-automatic fire, an alternative unported barrel assembly includes a sliding handguard connected to a rod moving the bolt by a pump action and eliminatingsemi-automatic fire. Most rifles eject spent cartridges from the right side of the receiver away from right handed shooters who place the butt against the right shoulder while sighting with the right eye and using a finger of the right hand to pull the trigger. Right-side ejection is a disadvantage for the third of the population whose left eye is dominant, and for the tenth of the population who are left handed, because holding these rifles against their left shoulder for maximum accuracy causes the rifle to eject hot spent cases toward the chest, neck or face of a left handed shooter. The modular design of AR-15 style rifles has encouraged several manufacturers to offer specialized parts including leftward ejecting upper receivers for converting right handed AR-15 style rifles for left handed use. Some AR-15-style rifles have features limiting use of detachable magazines to comply with state regulations. A few unusual versions are incapable ofsemi-automatic fire. Nearly all versions of the civilian AR-15 have a pistol grip like the military versions, and some have folding or collapsible stocks like the M4 carbine which reduce the overall length of the rifle. Comparison to military versions Thesemi-automatic civilian AR-15 was introduced by Colt in 1963. The primary distinction between civiliansemi-automatic rifles and military models is select fire. Military models were produced with firing modes,semi-automatic fire and either fully automatic fire mode or burst fire mode, in which the rifle fires three rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed. Most components are interchangeable betweensemi-auto and select fire rifles including magazines, sights, upper receiver, barrels and accessories. The military M4 carbine typically uses a 14.5'' barrel. Civilian rifles commonly have 16 inch or longer barrels to comply with the National Firearms Act. In order to prevent a civiliansemi-automatic AR-15 from being readily converted for use with the select fire components a number of features were changed. Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/ mode selector. Thesemi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected. Using a portion of the select fire parts in asemi-automatic rifle will not enable a select fire option. As designed by Colt the pins supporting thesemi-auto trigger and hammer in the lower receiver are larger than those used in the military rifle to prevent interchangeability betweensemi-automatic and select fire components. Production and sales A custom built AR-15 style rifle with an ACOG sight. The first version produced for commercial sale by Colt was the AR-15 Sporter, in. 223 Remington, with a 20-inch barrel and issued with 5-round magazines. Initial sales of the Colt AR-15 were slow, primarily due to its fixed sights and carry handle that made scopes difficult to mount and awkward to use. In the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy. While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled. From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500. Today, AR-15 style rifles are available in a wide range of configurations and calibers from a large number of manufacturers. These configurations range from standard full-sizes rifles with 20 inch barrels, to short carbine-length models with 16 inch barrels, adjustable length stocks and optical sights, to long range target models with 24 inch barrels, bipods and high-powered scopes. Estimates vary as to how many of the rifles are owned in the United States. The National Shooting Sports Foundation has estimated that approximately 5 million to 10 million AR-15 style rifles exist in the U.S. within the broader total of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans. Cartridge variations Since the upper and lower receivers may be swapped between rifles, forensic firearm examination of bullets and spent cartridges may reveal distinguishing marks from the barrel and upper receiver group without identifying the lower receiver for which legal records may be available. An individual may use several upper receiver groups with the same lower receiver. These upper receiver groups may have differing barrel lengths and sights, and may fire different cartridges. A hunter with a single lower receiver might have one upper receiver with a. 223 Remington barrel and telescopic sight for varmint hunting in open country and another upper receiver with a. 458 SOCOM barrel and iron sights for big-game hunting in brushy woodland. The dimensions of upper and lower receivers originally designed for the 5.56\u00d7 45mm NATO cartridge impose an overall length limit and diameter limits when adapting modules for other cartridges included in this list of AR platform calibers. The same magazine in the lower receiver group may hold differing numbers of different cartridges. Use in Crime and mass shootings While most gun killings in the United States are with handguns, AR-15 style rifles have played ``an oversized role in many of the most high-profile'' mass shootings in the United States, and have come to be widely characterized as the weapon of choice for perpetrators of these crimes. AR-15 variants were the primary weapon used in the most recent six of the ten deadliest mass shootings in American history, including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2015 San Bernardino attack, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting, and the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Following the use of a Colt AR-15 rifle in the Port Arthur massacre, the worst single-person shooting incident in Australian history, the country enacted the National Firearms Programme Implementation Act 1996, restricting the private ownership ofsemi-automatic rifles with a capacity of more than 5 rounds (Category D).

Pilate orders the crucifixion of Jesus in order to maintain the peace and satisfy his people. Overcome with guilt for betraying Jesus, Judas hangs himself in the wastelands. Caiaphas defends his decision to send Jesus to Pilate with his father-in-law Annas. The act will send a message to all who oppose Roman law. Annas suggests a quicker death. Pilate grants two requests: Jesus 'expedited death and Joseph of Arimathea's petition to claim the body. Pilate's wife Claudia warns that he will regret crucifying Jesus, who soon dies on the cross. Jerusalem trembles and the temple's holy veil splits. A soldier arrives to ensure Jesus 'death, and Joseph offers his tomb as a final resting place. There he, Mother Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene clean the body and pray before closing the tomb. Caiaphas requests that Pilate post soldiers outside the tomb and place a Roman seal across the front, which will carry the death penalty if broken. Pilate agrees. Peter admits to John and Mary Magdalene that he denied Jesus, as the remaining disciples gather at the safe house. They all argue over the next course of action and Mother Mary reminds them of the prophesied return of Jesus. They decide to leave the city if he doesn't return on the third day. Soon, another tremble and the tomb illuminates behind its seal. An angel dressed as a warrior appears on top of the tomb and exposes its sword, a sign to the shocked Roman guards to not interfere. Later, Caiaphas receives news that the Roman seal has been broken, the tomb opened, and Jesus is gone. ``The Body Is Gone'' Ciaran Donnelly Simon Block April 12, 2015 (2015-04-12) 7.75 Mary Magdalene sneaks to Joseph's tomb and finds it open. Nothing is inside but the shroud that Jesus wore on the cross, left perfectly folded. She returns to the safe house to tell the others. Caiaphas listens to Reuben and the other guards try to explain what happened--a warrior angel broke the seal and moved the massive stone. Caiaphas thinks that some followers of Jesus must have raided the tomb in an attempt to fake a resurrection. Caiaphas gives his men strict orders to say that they fell asleep on duty if asked, and instructs Reuben to find Jesus 'body immediately. Caiaphas then lies to Pilate that Jesus is dead in the tomb; however, a tomb guard reports otherwise after Caiaphas leaves. After being left at the empty tomb by Peter and John, Mary Magdalene is visited by Jesus, who is without stain. She returns to the chaotic safe house to report the news. Jesus appears to his disciples and later to a doubting Thomas, before guards storm the safe house and the disciples scatter into the city. Pilate orders the deaths of most of Caiaphas 'guards, as Reuben and Caiaphas search the city for the body of Jesus. The disciples make it to the coast of the Sea of Galilee, where Peter finds it difficult catching fish. A man appears and instructs him to cast the net on the right side of the boat. The net quickly becomes filled with fish, and the men confirm their adviser to be Jesus. He suggests that they return to Jerusalem, wait there, then spread the word. Jesus then climbs a hill and disappears in a bright light. Angry over the death of his men, Caiaphas confronts Pilate, who then kills the tomb guards in front of him as a lesson in ``civic administration''. ``The Spirit Arrives'' Ciaran Donnelly Andy Rattenbury April 19, 2015 (2015-04-19) 6.36 Leah comforts her distressed husband Caiaphas by saying that his men's deaths was Pilate's order to quash any rumor of resurrection. Pilate confesses to Claudia about killing the soldiers in the palace, which is preparing for King Herod Antipas 'visit. Upon his arrival, Antipas asks Caiaphas why the city feels as if it is about to erupt. He assures King Antipas that it has nothing to do with the recent crucifixion, but Antipas says that Caiaphas mishandled to entire thing by involving the Romans and warns to not do it again. Peter's daughter Maya joins him at the safe house, and she suggests prayer to be the disciples 'solution for their future missions. After the Holy Spirit fills them, they confidently set out to spread the word. Caiaphas ensures the widow of a guard that his murderer will be found, but Leah tells her to leave the city. Claudia remains distant from Pilate, but asks Cornelius to look after him during the Festival of Pentecost. The disciples enter the temple and heal a crippled man in the name of Jesus, only to be beaten by Reuben and his men. Peter and John are arrested, but they are proud that their mission has begun. An assassination attempt is made on Pilate which results in the death of Roman soldier Drusus. Pilate orders the deaths of those in the vicinity of the crime. Upon seeing the dead bodies of his townspeople, Caiaphas knows that he must stand up for himself and his fellow Jews against the ruthless Romans. ``The Wrath'' Tony Mitchell Ben Newman April 26, 2015 (2015-04-26) 5.77 Pilate decrees that ten Jews will be crucified every day until the assassin is found. As Thomas baptizes Stephen, Maya announces her return to the city to check on her father, and Mary Magdalene joins her to keep her promise of Maya's safety to Peter. Cornelius and his men search the city for Boaz, after finding in his shop the knife used in the attempt. Caiaphas puts Peter and John on public trial. The crowd supports their miracles under God's name and Caiaphas is forced to release them, with the caveat to not teach nor speak Jesus 'name. Peter and John's popularity grows after their release, which overwhelms Peter. Mother Mary comforts him by stating that Jesus knew that Peter's faith would help him with his new responsibilities. John has a dream that leads him to the Temple, where he recruits Barnabas, who gives his land to the cause. Levi finds Boaz and warns him of the ease in doing so, adding that he should leave the city. Boaz visits the new commune, and Peter says that he can live there as long as he repents of his sins. Boaz refuses, relying on his Jewish identity and not the name of Jesus. The Holy Spirit shows Peter a vision of Ananias and Sapphira hiding money, despite their telling Peter that they donated everything to the commune. When confronted, both die, drowning in their own fluids. Caiaphas disrespects Pilate, and Claudia gives Boaz's name to Leah, hoping to end the chaos. 5 ``The First Martyr'' Tony Mitchell Ben Newman May 3, 2015 (2015-05-03) 5.47 After Peter's trial, the people of the camp have become afraid of him. Mother Mary assures him that, in time, faith will give them understanding, but pain and despair are currently in control. Jesus came to free them from it. Peter gathers the apostles; they will go to Jerusalem to offer their fearful followers sanctuary in the camp. Once in Jerusalem, Peter and the apostles are stunned to find their former safe house filled with scared converts and refugees. With no assassin news, Pilate orders Cornelius to seize 10 Jewish women from a wedding party and crucify them. Cornelius and his men take 10 Jews from the market to crucify. Meanwhile, Leah finds a worried Caiaphas and shares the assassin's name (Boaz), adding that his fianc\u00e9e Eva has been found and could flush him out. Leah visits Eva, asking her to persuade Boaz to give himself up, hoping to end Pilate's crucifixions. Eva remains stoic. Boaz turns himself in to Caiaphas and Reuben. Pilate has Cornelius to torture Boaz, who is then spared when Levi the leader of the Zealots shoots him with an arrow, killing him. Later, Stephen publicly condemns Caiaphas for refusing the Word of God, and he is stoned to death while a young man named Saul of Tarsus is watching. 6 ``The Persecution'' Tony Mitchell Damian Wayling May 10, 2015 (2015-05-10) 4.53 After Stephen's death by stoning, the disciples gather at the safe house to pray over his body. Back at the camp, Barnabas tells Philip that he dreamed that Stephen wouldn't be the last of them to die. The two men notice a stranger entering the camp, who introduces himself as Saul of Tarsus, a scholar, Jew, Roman, Pharisee, and defender of the Temple of Jerusalem. Saul claims that Jesus was nothing more than a false prophet, and preaching his message will bring nothing but wrath upon the disciples. While walking through the market, Annas asks his son Jonathan if he can not see that Caiaphas must be replaced because of his involvement with Pilate. Jonathan points out that Annas is plotting against his own son-in-law, but Annas waves him off. The Sanhedrin seeks Caiaphas's successor and now the family needs Jonathan to step up. Caiaphas is not happy to play host to Leah's family, and less happy to discover that Herod Antipas and Herodias have invited themselves to stay for the Purim festival. On their way, the royal couple stops off to survey the Nazarene's camp to see that it was so close to Jerusalem and densely populated. Over dinner, they admit that Purim was a useful excuse for them to check to see if the city still stands after Pilate's recent wave of crucifixions. Annas and Jonathan steer the conversation towards the Nazarene's encampment, sowing seeds of doubt against Caiaphas. Herodias and Antipas would prefer not to choose between Caiaphas and Jonathan. Nevertheless, he knows that he'll have to throw his support behind one of them and then let Pilate have the responsibility of dealing with the fallout. 7 ``The Visit'' Brian Kelly Andy Rattenbury May 17, 2015 (2015-05-17) 4.80 Saul and his men search Jerusalem for Peter and the disciples. Simon the Sorcerer fails to heal an unconscious woman in the market and asks to be baptized, following Philip's managing to do so in the name of Jesus. Roman Emperor Tiberius and his nephew Caligula enter Jerusalem. Tiberius has asked Antipas and Herodias to be in attendance of Pilate's governorship review. Pilate asks Caiaphas to speak for him. Emperor Tiberius dismisses all when talk of God arises. Later, Caiphas dupes Saul into thinking that Peter left for Damascus; Saul leaves Jerusalem in pursuit of Peter. Claudia escorts Tiberius to his bedchamber to hear his recollection of some dreams. She later tells Pilate that they must keep their nerve, as Tiberius is a tired old man. 8 ``The Road to Damascus'' Brian Kelly Damian Wayling May 24, 2015 (2015-05-24) 4.24 Caiaphas asks Reuben to escort Saul to Damascus, hoping that Tiberius will depart Jerusalem before Saul's return. The long trip to Damascus wears Reuben down, and he asks why Saul hates Peter. Saul angrily exclaims that God would not choose a simple fisherman to spread His message, adding that Jesus is an impostor. The sky then goes dark and Jesus appears to Saul in a ball of light. He instructs Saul to go to Damascus and await further instruction. Saul's men find him blinded and screaming for help. Jesus later appears to Ananias, saying that Saul is the chosen instrument to inform the Gentiles and their kings and the Jewish people and their priests. Ananias cures Saul of his blindness and later baptizes him. He becomes a new man and goes to the synagogue in Damascus to preach. John and Peter go to Samaria to assist Philip. Simon the Sorcerer offers to donate all of his money to help spread Jesus 'word, in exchange for ``a few drops of the Holy Spirit''. His bargaining attempt causes rage to explode from Peter and blood to flow from his eye sockets, but Peter urges him to repent and begs God for mercy on Simon. Upon witnessing Caligula's debauchery with Herod Agrippa, Claudia and Pilate counsel Tiberius, which includes separating them by sending Caligula back to Rome. Enraged, Caligula warns Pilate and Claudia that they will answer to him and that Tiberius 'reign and protection is nearing an end. Claudia dreams of Tiberius 'death by Caligula's hand. Antipas, Pilate, and their wives learn from Caligula that Tiberius died in his sleep. Caligula tears up Pilate's commission and proclaims himself to be the new emperor. (This is historically inaccurate because Tiberius died in 37 A.D., not 33 A.D.; also that Caligula was a good emperor for 6 months before devolving into a tyrant for his remaining 3 years of rule before his assassination in 41 A.D., the show portrayed him as a sadistic murdering bisexual from the get go.) 9 ``Saul's Return'' Rob Evans Tom Grieves May 31, 2015 (2015-05-31) 4.74 Saul's preaching at the Damascus synagogue sparks a riot from Saul's former friends, the Jews in Damascus. Barnabas helps him escape and with excitement they go back to Jerusalem to see Peter and the other disciples. Back in Jerusalem, Leah, furious at Saul's betrayal, orders Reuben to find him, shame him, and kill him for his switch of allegiance. Emperor Caligula gets no response from Claudia when asking her to show her devotion to her emperor. He asks the same of Aurelius, Tiberius 'advisor, who falls onto his own sword and dies. Just before leaving to Rome with Herod Agrippa, Caligula orders Pilate to erect a statue of him in the temple, the new ``king'' of the Jews. When Caiaphas learns of the statue plans, he cites the Book of Daniel (Chapter 8) and its foretelling of death and destruction. At the camp, Peter argues with Saul, who insists that he has turned to Jesus Christ and that they should carry on spreading His message. Claudia consults with Leah and Herodias regarding Caligula and his statue. Leah suggests making Saul a scapegoat, igniting a war between church and state. Meanwhile, the disciples learn of the statue plans and imagine that, once the ``abomination of desolation'' (the statue of Caligula) is set up, Jesus might return. However, Leah, Cornelius, Herodias, and Claudia discuss circumventing that, as well as the expected fallout from the proposed statue. Simon the Zealot, unhappy with the disciples accepting Saul, meets Eva, Boaz's widow, who calls it the first step to meeting the enemies of Rome and giving them news vital to the future of the Temple. While searching for Simon the Zealot, Saul is captured by Reuben and his men. Leah tells Caiaphas that Saul should be stoned publicly so that the Jewish people may learn what happens to a man who betrays the high priest. Caiaphas then neglects that idea and says that it might be possible to try to talk Saul out of his new faith and prove the fact that belief in the ``dead'' Jesus can change no one. But Caiaphas goes to the prison and sees Saul praying to Jesus; he realizes that it will be harder than he thinks. 10 ``Brothers In Arms'' Rob Evans Rachel Anthony June 7, 2015 (2015-06-07) 4.09 Caiaphas talks with Saul about how he came to the high priest and demanded that he could attack the ``blasphemers'' and defend the Temple. Saul replies that he wanted to impress Caiaphas but now he understands truth. Caiaphas threatens Saul with the idea of what Gamaliel his teacher would make of his new understanding and asks him to rejoin the Temple. But Saul declares that the Temple is a temporary home and that no one except Jesus can forgive him and He already did by fulfilling prophet Isaiah's words and recreating him in Jesus 'name. Caiaphas punches Saul and threatens him with misery when Saul says that there is no need for the Temple or for the high priest. However, eventually, Saul is released by Caiaphas, much to Leah's dismay. Leah requests that Saul's release be under the condition of forgiveness, but Caiaphas denies it, saying that he is busy uniting the Jews to fight the statue being brought in by the Romans. Meanwhile, James the Just, Jesus 'childhood friend, visits the disciples and talks to Caiaphas about ending the persecution brought on the followers of Jesus. Caiaphas offers the disciples peace and sanctification, but they are reluctant considering the amount of harm that Caiaphas did to them. Controversy erupts with the disciples and Saul over the function of the Temple. James the Just argues that, since they're Jews, the Temple is important, but Saul says that they follow Jesus and He is more important and they have a message to preach. This creates suspicion and resentment in the heart of Simon the Zealot, and Levi the leader of the Zealots is able to use those feelings to get Simon the Zealot to side with him and possibly against Saul. A wealthy Ethiopian treasurer visits Jerusalem and Pilate invites him to dine in the Roman palace. The Ethiopian treasurer wants peace from his enemies, to which Pilate and Antipas argue that they are enemies. In the meantime, with the encouragement and ministry of Joanna and Mary Magdalene, Tabitha becomes a Christian, but is discovered by Claudia and Herodias, finally is scourged by Pilate's orders. However, Saul consoles Tabitha that no one can stand against the love of Jesus, which brings a change in Simon the Zealot, who warns the other disciples of the Zealots 'intention to kill Saul. Pilate plans to kill Joanna to make her death count, but Claudia gives her food each night to keep her strength up. Unbeknownst to them, a scheme is made between the Ethiopians and the Zealots. 11 ``Rise Up'' Paul Wilmshurst Ben Newman June 14, 2015 (2015-06-14) 3.99 Pilate kills Joanna and exiles the Ethiopian treasurer for collaboration with the Zealots; the disciples send Saul back to Tarsus to preach; Peter heals Aeneas and resurrects Tabitha (from Acts 9), winning new converts to the faith. The Jewish people and the Zealots rally for war, but distrust each other. Upon witnessing the Ethiopian treasurer banished, Caiaphas suspects that his wife Leah might have had a hand in it. A change is seen in Claudia and Cornelius after the death of Joanna. Philip returns to Jerusalem and meets Peter again. The two have a good time talking, then an angel dressed as a warrior instructs Philip to go to the road that leads from Jerusalem to the Mediterranean Sea. While on the road, Philip meets the Ethiopian treasurer reading the prophet Isaiah's writings, given to him by Caiaphas the high priest. Philip explains to the Ethiopian that the writings speak of a man who knew great suffering that produced great faith and, in the end, that man bore our transgressions for us, was killed, then rose again-Jesus Christ the son of God. While traveling with Philip, the Ethiopian believes and is baptized. After baptizing the Ethiopian believer, Philip is transported back to Samaria. Emperor Caligula's statue (made of pure gold) enters Jerusalem with the promise of total war and destruction. 12 ``The Abomination'' Paul Wilmshurst Tom Grieves June 21, 2015 (2015-06-21) 3.56 Emperor Caligula's golden statue arrives in Jerusalem which draws everyone in rebellion against the Romans including the high priest. Pilate meets with Caiaphas and his wife Leah to tell them that the golden statue of Emperor Caligula must enter the Temple whether they like it or not. Caiaphas opposes, saying that he can't help Pilate anymore. Pilate taunts Caiaphas by saying that Leah, Caiaphas 'wife, is a friend of his because she helped him expose a past conspiracy between the Ethiopians and the Zealots. Caiaphas replies that his wife Leah gave the information with his knowledge so he is untainted and Pilate has no allies or victims and the Caligula statue made of gold will never enter the Temple. Meanwhile, Peter and Mary Magdalene are led to the house of Cornelius, now ready to repent of his sins and become a Christian. After being baptized and accepting Jesus, Cornelius and his family are filled with the Holy Spirit, to Peter and Mary Magdalene's amazement. Caiaphas calls a meeting with James the Just to tell him that, if the disciples join him, they can repel the statue of Caligula. James the Just denies the offer, saying that he worships Jesus and can not use violence. Enraged, Caiaphas swears that he will persecute all the disciples of Jesus and that they have no interest in anything but themselves. On the heights of the Temple, Caiaphas chides his wife Leah for conspiring with Pilate. Leah says that it had to be done, at which Caiaphas banishes her to her home. Leah asks her father and brother Annas and Jonathan for assistance, but they deny her request. Pilate tries to convince his wife Claudia that his responsibilities as governor are important and he has no choice in what he does. Claudia informs Pilate that he enjoys the bloody things which he does. Pilate asks about the subject of Joanna and then says that she was nothing. Claudia denies that and says that he can not win every battle. Obsessed with winning the war and half-insane with determination, Pilate hits Claudia and forces her to back down. The disciples stand with the high priest and the other rabbis which stops the newly converted Cornelius from attacking them. The resistance of the Zealots is crushed but the gold statue of the Emperor gets damaged in the process. Peter informs the other disciples that the prophecy of Daniel won't be fulfilled today and that Cornelius was converted by him. At his palace, Pilate refuses to concede defeat and says that next time he'll rebuild the statue and be tougher with the Jews. Disgusted with Pilate's brutal plans, Claudia tries to leave him but, as she is going with Cornelius, she refuses and chooses to be dominated by him. Peter tries to explain his conversion of Cornelius to James the Just and the other disciples, but he is taken away by Roman soldiers. The age of the disciples 'martyrdom has now begun.

Contents (hide) 1 Biography 2 Ethical and religious issues 3 References 4 External links Biography (edit) Louise Joy Brown was born at Oldham General Hospital, Oldham, by planned Caesarean section delivered by registrar John Webster. She weighed 5 pounds, 12 ounces (2.608 kg) at birth. Her parents, Lesley and John Brown, had been trying to conceive for nine years. Lesley faced complications of blocked fallopian tubes. On 10 November 1977, Lesley Brown underwent a procedure, later to become known as IVF (in vitro fertilisation), developed by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards. Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work. Although the media referred to Brown as a ``test tube baby'', her conception actually took place in a Petri dish. Her younger sister, Natalie Brown, was also conceived through IVF four years later, and became the world's fortieth child after conception by IVF. In May 1999, Natalie was the first human born after conception by IVF to give birth herself--without IVF--to daughter Casey. Natalie has subsequently had three additional children; sons Christopher, Daniel, and Aeron, the last of whom was born in August 2013. In 2004, Brown married nightclub doorman (bouncer) Wesley Mullinder. Dr. Edwards attended their wedding. Their son Cameron, conceived naturally, was born on 20 December 2006. Brown's second son, Aiden Patrick Robert, was born in August 2013. Brown's father died in 2007. Her mother died on 6 June 2012 in Bristol Royal Infirmary at the age of 64 due to complications from a gallbladder infection. Ethical and religious issues (edit) See also: Moral theology of John Paul I Although the Browns knew the procedure was experimental, the doctors did not tell them that no case had yet resulted in a baby. This has raised questions of informed consent. Shortly before the death of Pope Paul VI, when asked for his reaction to Brown's birth, the patriarch of Venice, Cardinal Albino Luciani (later Pope John Paul I), expressed concerns about the possibility that artificial insemination could lead to women being used as ``baby factories'', but also refused to condemn the parents of the child, noting they simply wanted to have a baby.

By virtue of this authority and the authority vested under him under section 22 of the Indian Councils Act 1861 the Governor General in Council enacted laws for the country from 1834 to 1920. After the commencement of the Government of India Act 1919 the legislative power was exercised by the Indian Legislature constituted thereunder. The Government of India Act 1919 was followed by the Government of India Act 1935.

(24) The CBDT provides essential inputs for policy and planning of direct taxes in India and is also responsible for administration of the direct tax laws through Income Tax Department. The CBDT is a statutory authority functioning under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963.It is India's official FATF unit. The Central Board of Revenue as the Department apex body charged with the administration of taxes came into existence as a result of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. Initially the Board was in charge of both direct and indirect taxes. However, when the administration of taxes became too unwieldy for one Board to handle, the Board was split up into two, namely the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Central Board of Excise and Customs with effect from 1.1. 1964. This bifurcation was brought about by constitution of the two Boards u/ s 3 of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963.

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10-to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a set of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller ``satellite'' pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.

Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft). Based on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880--82 and published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the north-eastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetre wide (1/ 50 of an inch). Great Pyramid of Giza from a 19th-century stereopticon card photo The pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over3,800 years, unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520 ft) spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed c. 1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only 58 millimetres in length. The base is horizontal and flat to within\u00b1 15 mm (0.6 in). The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four minutes of arc) based on true north, not magnetic north, and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc. The completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 Egyptian Royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/ 280 Egyptian Royal cubits equates to 2 \u03c0 to an accuracy of better than 0.05 percent (corresponding to the well-known approximation of \u03c0 as 22/ 7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, ``We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of \u03c0, in practice they used it''. Petrie, author of Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh concluded: ``but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design''. Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building. In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza. Materials The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid, found in the ``King's'' chamber, weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than 800 km (500 mi) away. Traditionally, ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid. It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone,8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid. Casing stones Casing stone in the British Museum. At completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white ``casing stones''--slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white limestone. These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a seked of51\u20442 palms to give the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today. In AD 1303, a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by Bahri Sultan An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo. Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his Alabaster Mosque in Cairo, not far from Giza. These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site. Nevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day in situ around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193 centimetres\u00b1 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation. Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being ``equal to opticians 'work of the present day, but on a scale of acres'' and ``to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible''. It has been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's ``cement'') that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly. Construction theories Main article: Egyptian pyramid construction techniques Clay seal bearing the name of Khufu from the Great Pyramid. On display at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. Many alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques. Many disagree on whether the blocks were dragged, lifted, or even rolled into place. The Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers 'camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of skilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a hierarchy, consisting of two gangs of100,000 men, divided into five zaa or phyle of20,000 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers. One mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that ``such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means''. He also argues for a 14-year time-span for its construction. A modern construction management study, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used critical path analysis methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years. Interior Diagram of the interior structures of the Great Pyramid. The inner line indicates the pyramid's present profile; the outer line indicates the original profile. The original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres (56 ft) vertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9 ft) east of the centre line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0.96 metres (3.1 ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide, which goes down at an angle of 26\u00b031'23'' through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres (345.2 ft), the passage becomes level and continues for an additional 8.84 metres (29.0 ft) to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid. 28.2 metres (93 ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3 metres (129 ft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long. One must use the Robbers 'Tunnel (see below) to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal Passage leading to the ``Queen's Chamber''. The passage is 1.1 m (3'8 ``) high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7 ft) high. Queen's Chamber Richard Pococke's sketch of Pyramid of Cheops from 1754. The ``Queen's Chamber'' is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid and measures 5.75 metres (18.9 ft) north to south, 5.23 metres (17.2 ft) east to west, and has a pointed roof with an apex 6.23 metres (20.4 ft) above the floor. At the eastern end of the chamber there is a niche 4.67 metres (15.3 ft) high. The original depth of the niche was 1.04 metres (3.4 ft), but has since been deepened by treasure hunters. In the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber there are shafts, which, unlike those in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards (see below), are horizontal for around 2 m (6.6 ft) before sloping upwards. The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of his shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black diorite (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose. Both objects are currently in the British Museum. The shafts in the Queen's Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of 65 m (213 ft), he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone ``doors'' with two eroded copper ``handles''. Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it. The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door. Research continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project. Realizing the problem was that the National Geographic Society's camera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fibre-optic ``micro snake camera'' that could see around corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint. They were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper ``handles'' embedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes. They also found the reverse side of the ``door'' to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason. Grand Gallery The Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid of Giza The Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage, but is 8.6 metres (28 ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1 ft) long. At the base it is 2.06 metres (6.8 ft) wide, but after 2.29 metres (7.5 ft) the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 7.6 centimetres (3.0 in) on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery, so that each stone fits into a slot cut in the top of the gallery like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure. At the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837--1838 by Colonel Howard Vyse and J.S. Perring, who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder. The floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, 51 centimetres (20 in) wide, leaving a lower ramp 1.04 metres (3.4 ft) wide between them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by vertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross shape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage. This, in turn, has led to the proposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to completely fill the Ascending Passage. At the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal passage some metres long and approximately 1.02 metres (3.3 ft) in height and width, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably intended to hold granite portcullises. Fragments of granite found by Petrie in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished doors. In 2017, scientists from the Scan Pyramids Project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery, using muon radiography that can detect cosmic rays. Its length is at least 30 metres (98 ft) and itscross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. It was detected using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. The purpose of the cavity is not known and it is not accessible but according to Zahi Hawass it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery. The Japanese research team disputes this, however, saying that the huge void is completely different from the construction spaces previously identified. King's Chamber Sarcophagus in the King's chamber The ``King's Chamber'' is 20 Egyptian Royal cubits or 10.47 metres (34.4 ft) from east to west and 10 cubits or 5.234 metres (17.17 ft) north to south. It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. 0.91 m (3.0 ft) above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a dog-leg course through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be ``air shafts'' for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the king's spirit to the heavens. The King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's Chamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the final chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper chambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as ``Davison's Chamber'', ``Wellington's Chamber'', ``Nelson's Chamber'', ``Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber'', and ``Campbell's Chamber''. It is believed that the compartments were intended to safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing under the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended to be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still retain masons 'marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber bears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang. The entrance of the Pyramid The only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite sarcophagus, one corner of which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw-marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. Petrie suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from Aswan and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead. Modern entrance Today tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers 'Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram. The tunnel is cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid for approximately 27 metres (89 ft), then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden. Pyramid complex Main article: Giza pyramid complex Map of Giza pyramid complex--``Pyramid of Khufu'' refers to the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171 ft) north to south and 40 metres (130 ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated. The basalt blocks show ``clear evidence'' of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of 15 feet (4.6 m) in length, capable of cutting at a rate of 1.5 inches (38 mm) per minute. John Romer suggests that this ``super saw'' may have had copper teeth and weighed up to 300 pounds (140 kg). He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it. On the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as the Queens 'Pyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the first course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the paving around the pyramid was the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty. Group photo of Australian 11th Battalion soldiers on the Great Pyramid in 1915. Aerial photography, taken from Eduard Spelterini's balloon on 21 November 1904 The Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, is surrounded by a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner has discovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as ``The Lost City'', dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520--2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490--2472 BC). Recent discoveries by Mark Lehner and his team at the town and nearby, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggest the town and associated living quarters consisting of barracks called ``galleries'' may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner now suggests the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries. In the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. This mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he identified with an artisans 'settlement. Mudbrick buildings just south of Khufu's Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death. A worker's cemetery used at least between Khufu's reign and the end of the Fifth Dynasty was discovered south of the Wall of the Crow by Zahi Hawass in 1990. Boats Main article: Khufu ship There are three boat-shaped pits around the pyramid, of a size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled. In May 1954, the Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were1,224 pieces of wood, the longest 23 metres (75 ft) long, the shortest 10 centimetres (0.33 ft). These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years. The result is a cedar-wood boat 43.6 metres (143 ft) long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.

In its SVG file, hover over a pyramid to highlight and click for its article. Although succeeding pyramids were smaller, pyramid-building continued until the end of the Middle Kingdom. However, as authors Brier and Hobbs claim, ``all the pyramids were robbed'' by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in a desert valley, now known as the Valley of the Kings, began. Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself ``is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom'', before the Arab caliph Abdullah al-Mamun entered the pyramid around AD 820. I.E.S. Edwards discusses Strabo's mention that the pyramid ``a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations''. Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: ``If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones'', in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find the entrance. He also discusses a story told by Herodotus. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Cheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had ``almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus'' and that it might have been closed again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by Pyramid guides.

Joey has seven sisters: Mary Therese (Mimi Lieber) aka Mary Teresa Christina Ricci, Mary Angela (Holly Gagnier), Dina (Marla Sokoloff), Gina (Drea de Matteo), Tina (Lisa Maris), Veronica (Dena Miceli), and Cookie (Alex Meneses). Joey is from Queens, New York and is Catholic. As a child, he was extremely accident prone. He also had an imaginary friend, Maurice, who was a space cowboy. Joey is portrayed as promiscuous, and dim-witted, but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. He's a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his ``ladies man'' personality, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and foosball. He loves sandwiches and pizza. He is a big fan of Baywatch. As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister in ``The One with the Truth About London'', and officiated at both Monica and Chandler and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. He does not like sharing food and has difficulty with simple mathematics. In sports, Joey likes the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees in baseball, Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks in basketball, New York Giants and New York Jets in football, and the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers in ice hockey. Contents (hide) 1 Appearances 2 Joey 3 References 4 External links Appearances (edit) Joey is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, having refused to follow in his father's footsteps and become a pipe fitter. He started his acting profession doing stage work, introduced in the show's pilot episode by Monica and Chandler having seen Joey in a production of Pinocchio. Sometime prior to the start of the series, Joey also had appeared in a porn film, as a fully clothed extra. Joey also mentioned appearing in a play with trolls before getting the leading role of Sigmund Freud in the musical play Freud! where he was first spotted by his talent agent Estelle Leonard. She immediately got him a film role in the same episode as Al Pacino's ``butt double''--a speechless role he later lost due to taking the part too seriously. Monica and Chandler also once discussed having seen Joey in a version of Macbeth, in which he was unable to pronounce most of the words. Joey becomes an ``actor-slash-model'' when he appears on print ads for the NYC Free Clinic, as a man named ``Mario'' who has a Venereal disease. He also did an infomercial for a device that lets you pour milk out of milk cartons; he played ``Kevin'', a man who had extreme difficulty opening the cartons without the use of the device. (``Kevin'' also inadvertently choked on a cookie during the show.). This haunted him again when he appeared in the play 'The King ', where he was made fun of due to choking on a cookie. In Season Two, Joey continued his stage work, appearing as ``The King'' in a poorly reviewed (and never-named) play. Published reviews of his performance claimed he was ``disturbingly unskilled'' and that he achieved ``brilliant new levels of sucking'' in a ``mediocre play'' with ``mindless, adolescent direction''. Only days after these reviews came out, Joey gets his big break when he lands his first major role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on the soap opera Days of Our Lives. He had initially gone in to read for a one-shot role as a cab driver; it is implied that he got the recurring role of Ramoray by sleeping with the casting director. While still playing Ramoray, he also appears in a bit role as a dead man in the film Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Several episodes later, Joey costs himself the Days of our Lives gig when during an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he lies claiming that he makes up his own lines. This angers the show's writers, who out of spite, ``kill off'' his character by having Dr. Ramoray fall down an elevator shaft. Joey takes this very hard and admits that his role on Days was the best thing that ever happened to him. He goes back to stage acting in Season Three appearing in a play called Boxing Day opposite love interest Kate Miller. The play seems to start out as a conventional drama but ends with Joey's character ``Victor'' is taken from his apartment by aliens. In Season Four, he lands a small one-scene movie role as a cop, playing his scene opposite Charlton Heston. Joey had some bad luck in terms of his acting career. In Season Five, he is cast in the independent film Shutter Speed, but it is shut down before filming began in Las Vegas. He is also fired from a Burger King commercial. He filmed a role in a Law& Order episode that was cut from the completed episode--Joey was only ``seen'' as a corpse in a body bag. In seasons 6 and 7, he lands a starring role as Detective 'Mac 'Machiavelli in a very short-lived, and very bad cop show called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E, which Chandler described as ``one of the worst things ever... and not just on TV.'' Joey had high hopes for the series, however Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E was canceled halfway through its first season. In Season 7, Joey auditions for the role of Dr. Striker Ramoray, a new character on ``Days of Our Lives'' and Drake Ramoray's brother but he doesn't get that role. Eventually, Joey's luck turns when he gets back his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and even nominated for an award for Best Returning Character, first as a character in coma, then revived through a brain transplant with another character Jessica Lockhart, (played by Susan Sarandon). In Season 7 he later replaces Susan Sarandon as Dr. Drake Jessica Ramoray. Later in the spin-off Joey, it turns out he loses his Role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and has to again hunt for a new job. Later in season 7, Joey landed a supporting role as ``Tony'', a soldier, in a major film opposite an Oscar-nominated actor named Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman). The film was a World War I period film entitled Over There. Joey is also briefly employed at Central Perk as a waiter. Facing a dry spell in his career as an actor, Joey is persuaded by Gunther, the manager, to take a job serving coffee. At first Joey tries to hide his new job from his friends, but they eventually figure it out. He does not like the work but, true to his nature, soon finds a way to use his position to meet and ingratiate himself to attractive women by giving them free food, a practice to which Gunther quickly puts a stop. Joey doesn't take his job very seriously and spends a lot of his working hours sitting and talking to his friends. Eventually he is fired for closing the coffeehouse in the middle of the day to go to an audition while Gunther was running a personal errand. Rachel later persuaded Gunther to give Joey back his job, but once Joey found more steady acting jobs he eventually just stopped showing up. His absence was barely noticed. In a later episode, Joey realizes he forgot to tell Gunther he quit, to which Gunther replied that he would have eventually fired him anyway. Joey is also briefly a sperm donor for a medical experiment; at the end, the hospital would pay any donor$700. This was later mentioned when Monica goes to a sperm bank. Joey finds to his dismay that his sperm is not very popular. Some of Joey's other jobs have included selling Christmas trees, dressing as Santa Claus and as a Christmas elf, working as a tour guide at the Museum of Natural History where Ross worked, offering perfume samples to customers at a department store, and as a Roman warrior at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. He also worked at the restaurant ``Alessandro's'' where Monica was head chef, nicknaming himself ``Dragon'' while on the job. Monica hired him just so she could fire him to intimidate the other employees who paid Monica no respect, but he made a lot of tips and backed out of the deal, only to realize how important his getting fired was to Monica. He then set himself up to be fired the next day. He spends one episode working with Chandler as an entry-level data processor. He treats the job like another acting role, in which he is ``Joseph the Processing Guy'' and creates a complex back-story for the character. Chandler begins to dislike the Joseph character when he starts showing up Chandler at work. Joey eventually leaves after Chandler pretends to sleep with Joey's ``pretend wife''. Prior to Monica and Chandler's wedding, when the two admitted that they were having trouble finding someone to perform the ceremony, Joey volunteered for the role, subsequently getting himself ordained over the Internet to entitle him to perform the marriage. He has apparently retained this role until Season Ten, when he performed the ceremony for Phoebe and Mike's wedding, claiming that priests are allowed to ride the subway for free (Although he states that the Bible must be read very carefully to identify the passage that permits this). Joey is characterized as a simple-minded but good-natured womanizer who loves food. He particularly loves meatball sub sandwiches. When asked if he would give up sex or food he had trouble deciding and kept blurting out sex or food, eventually yelling ``I want girls on bread!''. In ``The One with the Ride Along'', he appears to be saving Ross from a putative gunshot, when it was actually his meatball sandwich that he was trying to save; it just happened to be next to Ross. He also loves the ``Joey Special''--two pizzas. His greed when it comes to food is also shown in the episode ``The One With the Birth Mother'' where he refuses to call Sarah the next day. When Phoebe asks why, Joey explains how Sarah broke his golden commandment on their date-not to share food. Phoebe's shocked to say the least, but Rachel admits to her how this is who Joey is. Nonetheless, Phoebe makes Joey go out with Sarah again, making him order extra fries should the need arise. Joey does so, but Sarah really wants to dig in his seafood platter, making him drop his plate to the floor in the process. This makes him explain how ``Joey doesn't share food'', which she seems to understand. However, things change course when Joey wants to nibble at her chocolate torte. As he wouldn't share his food with her, she reciprocates and warns him not to touch any of her desserts while she wanders off to take a call. When she arrives, her dessert is pretty much gone; Joey, with chocolate torte all over his face, is at peace with himself, and admits that he's ``not even sorry!''. He is something of an idiot savant in general, but capable of good ideas when the situation arises; this is alluded to in the episode ``The One Where Ross Dates a Student'', when Chandler, referring to Joey, says ``A hot girl's at stake and suddenly he's Rain Man'' when Joey suggested Ross work out who among his students called him the 'hottie of the paleontology department 'by comparing the handwriting of the note to the handwriting in the class essays. In another example, Joey made up an anecdote referred to as the ``Europe story'' or the ``magic story''; apparently, anyone who hears it will immediately want to have sex with the teller. This is proven to be effective when Rachel successfully uses the story on Ross. Being a glutton when it comes to food, Joey is shown throughout the series to have the uncanny ability to eat enormous quantities of food. As he prides the Tribbiani family for their eating prowess (``We might not be (...) world leaders, but damn it, we can eat!''), he takes on Monica's challenge to eat a whole roast turkey virtually all by himself. In season 8, episode 9, Monica is unwilling to cook a whole roast turkey for Thanksgiving dinner as Rachel is pregnant, Chandler refuses to eat Thanksgiving food due to childhood traumas, Phoebe is a vegetarian, and dinner guest Will (played by Brad Pitt) is on a diet. Joey's love for Thanksgiving traditions, however, convinces Monica to roast the turkey only under the condition that Joey can eat the entire 19-pound bird in one sitting. When Monica sees him struggle, she says she is only kidding, but Joey perseveres and with a little help of Phoebe's maternity pants, he eventually not only consumes the entire turkey, but has room for dessert afterwards. A similar eating stunt happens in season 9, episode 5, when Joey is left alone at the dinner table in a restaurant after Phoebe's failed birthday dinner, and he is forced to eat six meals by himself. He finishes them, only to tuck into the birthday cake afterwards. Joey is extremely promiscuous, often relying on his catchphrase pickup line ``How you doin '?''. He regularly sleeps with attractive women, but can never seem to get into a committed relationship-judging from a conversation he had with Chandler at the latter's bachelor party he seems to regard marriage as depressing and restrictive. He sleeps with many of the interns and extras on shows on which he works. He has apparently been sexually active for a very long time; he undid a 16-year-old girl's bra when he was nine, slept with his teacher in the seventh grade, and had a ``wild spring break'' when he was 13. In the episode ``The One With Joey's Interview'', he slept with the interviewer (played by Sasha Alexander) so what he said about having a life and not watching soaps wasn't published in Soap Opera Digest. Despite his promiscuous nature towards many women throughout the series, he is highly protective and old-fashioned when it comes to the relationships of his own sisters. While he does not seem to have a problem with his own lifestyle, he repeatedly makes sure his sisters don't go down the same path. When he finds out in season 3, episode 11 that Chandler drunkenly made out with his sister Mary Angela, he attempts to force the two into a relationship. Later, in season 8, episode 10, Joey initially attempts to force his younger sister Dina into marriage with her hapless boyfriend upon hearing she's pregnant, but they play into his emotional nature by saying they want to raise the baby independently. They hug it out while Joey says the baby will ``of course have its uncle Joey''. While he is not very bright, Joey is a caring and kindhearted person. He let Rachel live with him when she was fighting with Ross, financially supported Monica and Chandler, and helped Phoebe find work when she was unemployed. He was willing to marry Phoebe and Rachel on the separate occasions he found out that each was pregnant. Joey is also the most physically powerful of the group, being able to easily push Ross over a couch with only one hand, and offering to go to the coffee house to intimidate two bullies into leaving Ross and Chandler alone. He is a Stephen King fan, having read The Shining several times, as well as being a fan of the film adaptation of one of King's novels, Cujo. He also becomes a fan of the classic novel, Little Women after Rachel asks him to read it to see if it was better than The Shining. Joey briefly mentions to the gang that Al Pacino is his idol. Joey has the poster for the 1983 Al Pacino film Scarface in his bedroom and the same poster is seen in his house in Joey. Joey, Ross and Chandler are huge fans of Die Hard. He moved apartment (s) four times in the series. The first time, he moved to his own lavish apartment away from Chandler (with whom the psychotic Eddie moved in) after he got the role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of Our Lives, though he moved back soon afterward due to his loss of the role. The other times were when he and Chandler moved into what is usually Monica's apartment, after winning it from her in a game in ``The One with the Embryos''. They were later forced back to their own apartment by the girls. Although Joey dated several women in the series, very few of these relationships were ever particularly serious, his romantic partners rarely appearing for more than one episode. However, despite his great interest in women, Joey has made it clear more than once that his friends were more important to him; when his latest relationship, Janine, stated that she strongly disliked Monica and Chandler, Joey soon broke it off with her despite the fact that he had been trying to win her over for the previous four episodes, telling Janine that Monica and Chandler were like his family and he couldn't be with Janine if she didn't like them. Joey was originally shunned by Chandler when he came in for a roommate interview, and Joey thought Chandler was gay. However, Mr. Heckles, another building resident, lied to Chandler's originally selected roommate, causing Chandler to have to go with his second choice roommate Joey (In ``The One with the Flashback'' set in 1993, Joey moved in 3 years before although in ``The One with All the Thanksgivings'' it shows that the gang knew Joey was Chandler's roommate in 1992 and he would have been his roommate for quite some time). Joey's first couple of days involved a brief, mutual attraction to Monica. This subsided and Chandler and Joey quickly became best friends as Joey's carefree lifestyle grew on Chandler. Later in the series, they bought a chick and a duck together, whom Chandler had named Yasmine and Dick, respectively. A long-running gag depicted Joey and Chandler occasionally fighting with each other like an old married couple. Joey moved out temporarily when he found success playing Dr. Drake Ramoray on a soap opera, but soon moved back in after his character was dropped down an elevator shaft. At the end of the series, Chandler and Monica made it clear to Joey that their new house outside the city would have a room for him. While Joey is best friends with Chandler, Ross is a close second (although Ross has been referred to as his best friend several times). At a time when Joey and Chandler had problems, when Chandler had kissed Joey's girlfriend, Joey stopped acting as Chandler's best friend and replaced him with Ross, although this only lasted until Chandler spent Thanksgiving in a box in order to show his remorse and apologize to him. Joey and Chandler have remained best friends ever since. Furthermore, Joey and Ross share a moment in an episode after watching Die Hard all night. They fall asleep on Ross 'couch, which is evidently enjoyed by Joey, as he tries to coerce Ross into more nap sessions with him. Also, earlier in the series, after much persuading by Joey, Ross gives in and kisses him to help him practice kissing men. In response, Joey replies that the audition was already over, he hadn't gotten the part, but the kiss was very well received. The major development of their relationship outside the realm of normal male interaction was when Joey fell in love with Rachel, Ross'sex-girlfriend and the object of Ross's affections since ninth grade. When Joey goes on to tell Ross about it, he can't say it in his face and instead says that he loves his ``friend's''ex-girlfriend. When asked if that ``friend'' (Ross) is a good guy, Joey honestly answers ``Yeah... He's the best''. Initially it causes a major rift, with Joey being apologetic, but when Ross sees Joey truly in love with Rachel he gives him the go ahead. Ross basically says that he's not okay with it but he wants to be, and the two's friendship deepens due to Joey's refusal to date Rachel unless Ross okays the deal. However, Joey and Rachel do not date long and later Joey encourages Ross to pursue Rachel in the season finale. Joey and Monica are close friends often joking around with each other. Joey allowed Monica to hire and fire him to prove to her employees that she was not a pushover. When he discovered that Monica and Chandler had developed a romantic relationship, he agreed to keep it secret until the two were ready to reveal it to the rest of their group. In an episode where he sees how close Chandler and Monica are, he dreams of himself and Monica in the same way. This later causes him to act weird around Monica. Finally he reveals this to Chandler and Monica, its that he wants a relationship like that, but Monica finds it nice thinking Joey thought of them two together. He also called Chandler moments after suspecting Monica of having an affair with a mystery male he had heard in her apartment. When Monica and Chandler needed their Engagement Picture taken, Chandler could not smile. In the newspaper announcement, it showed the photo was of Monica and Joey. Joey always enjoyed a close relationship with Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe; LeBlanc once speculated that Joey saw the girls as sisters more than potential romantic interests. However, the tension between Monica and Joey is at times fairly obvious and it is made clear that the two have a very close, almost intimate, relationship, though it is never consummated on the show. According to DVD commentary of the pilot episode, Joey and Monica were initially meant to be the principal love connection of the show but was overshadowed by the Ross-Rachel relationship. In Episode 1.07 ``The One with the Blackout'', Phoebe blurted to Joey that Monica has a crush on him when he was moving in with Chandler. This idea was revisited in Season 7 when it is revealed that Monica initially meant to hit on Joey in London, and not Chandler. She states that it was because she was looking for something meaningless, never expecting to have found Chandler and fall in love with him. The concept of what their marriage would have been like was then envisioned by Phoebe and it consisted of Monica cooking all the time for a very fat Joey. Phoebe is Joey's female best friend. They appear to understand each other. They are the only members of the group who lack a college education. Joey is Phoebe's best male friend; they have dinner together once a month to talk about the rest of the group and Joey like to be called 'Big daddy 'by phoebe. Both characters show a softness for each other, even when joking or when they are upset with the others. In ``The One with the Race Car Bed'', it is implied that Phoebe can hear Joey's thoughts. In ``The One With the Ride Along'', she explains that ``when the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all... not you, Joey''. In the episode ``The One in Vegas'', after Joey has said that no one will live in his hand shaped mansion, he adds ``Except you Pheebs... You can live in the thumb.'' When she was a surrogate mother for her brother's triplets and suddenly craved meat, Joey offered to eat no meat until the babies were born, to compensate for her consumption and, in a way, preserve her vegetarianism (no extra animals would have to be killed). In The One With All the Cheesecakes, it is shown that the two tried to meet once a month for dinner in order to discuss the other Friends. When Phoebe was upset because she'd turned thirty-one without having had the perfect kiss, Joey kissed her so that she could cross that off her list (also adding that he was one-sixteenth Portuguese when she mentioned that she hadn't met any Portuguese people). Joey did not have romantic feelings for Phoebe. Joey dates briefly Phoebe's twin sister Ursula, which upsets Phoebe; he breaks it off to preserve his friendship with Phoebe, however. When Monica finds out that Joey ``sees a friend in a different way'', she assumes it to be Phoebe. Phoebe, overwhelmed by the news, approaches Joey, only to find that it is Rachel. Phoebe also has Joey locked in as a backup for her marriage. When the Friends believe that the group may have to split up, Phoebe and Rachel conspire to form a separate group by themselves, but Phoebe insists that Joey be invited to their new group as well. Phoebe's loyalty is proved again when she states that she could live in Las Vegas, since it has everything she needs, ``Including Joey!''. He, in turn, invites her to live with him in the mansion he expected to own when he becomes rich from having a hand twin. When Joey learned from a customer at Central Perk that Phoebe was apparently a porn star, he refused to watch the movies even when the other four decided to do so. However, he shows a new interest in them when he learned that the film actually stars Ursula. When Joey believes Phoebe to be pregnant, he proposes, claiming the world is too scary for a single mother. This proposal is apparently made entirely without romantic intentions. Phoebe says yes and accepts his ring, but Monica tells Joey that it is Rachel who is pregnant, so Joey proposes to Rachel and must retrieve the ring from a reluctant Phoebe. Phoebe also sets up Joey with many of her friends. On a double date, Joey sets her up with a stranger, Mike (Paul Rudd), whom she eventually marries. In one episode, after persuasion from Rachel, he reads Little Women and she reads The Shining. She finds out that whenever he gets scared whilst reading he puts the book in the freezer. At the end of the episode, Joey is afraid that one of the characters is going to die and Rachel says 'Do you want to put it in the freezer? 'Their close friendship continues and when a fire destroys Rachel and Phoebe's apartment, Rachel moves in with Joey and stays there, even after her apartment has been repaired. Halfway through season 8, Joey and Rachel go out on a date, so that Rachel can have one night of fun before it becomes too obvious that she's pregnant. They have a great time, and afterwards, Joey starts developing feelings for Rachel unbeknown to her. He does not act on his feelings because he is too loyal to Ross and feels like it would betray him to have a possible relationship with Rachel. However, upon discovering that Joey's not just having a crush on Rachel, but is in fact in love with her, Ross encourages his friend to talk to her. Joey tells Rachel about his feelings, but she does not return them, and things are awkward between them for a while. In late season 9, Rachel starts developing feelings for Joey, but fears he does not feel the same way anymore and has already moved on, especially when he starts dating Charlie. When the gang goes to Barbados for a convention from Ross 'work, Joey finds out about Rachel's feelings, and even though he first says nothing can happen, he changes his mind when he sees Charlie and Ross kiss, and he goes back to Rachel's room to be with her. They continue their relationship for several episodes and gain Ross 'approval after he realizes it's been six years since his relationship with Rachel ended, and he should move on from that. When Rachel and Joey prepare for their first night together, however, they realize they're too close as friends to make their relationship work, with Rachel instinctively slapping Joey away when he tries to touch her as she suddenly finds herself unable to get past the fact that it's Joey touching her. After Chandler mentions how natural it was for him and Monica to make the transition from friends to lovers, Joey and Rachel realize they aren't on the same path and go back to being friends. At the end, when Chandler and Monica announce that they are moving into a house, Joey presents them with a housewarming gift of a chick and a duck, who are named Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. The pets remain in Joey's apartment. Joey (edit) After the 2003/ 2004 final season of Friends, Joey Tribbiani became the main character of Joey, a spin-off TV series, where he moved to L.A. to polish his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani and her son Michael (Paulo Costanzo) were two other central characters of the show. Joey turned down a role in a sitcom called Nurses to star in a different series pilot. His pilot did not get picked up, while Nurses became a huge hit. However, his acting career has had some better moments. In Joey, it is revealed that Joey's character of Dr. Drake Ramoray died again on Days of our Lives where he is stabbed by a nurse (``Joey and the Wrong Name''). He won a Daytime Soap Award for ``Best Death Scene''. In later Joey episodes, Joey landed a starring role on the prime time soap Deep Powder. When he got fired from that job, he almost immediately bounced back by snagging a leading role in the big-budget action picture Captured. The series 'penultimate episode sees Joey in an established and committed relationship with Alex Garrett, his next-door neighbor.

The Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors 4--3 in a rematch of the 2015 NBA Finals. It was the 14th rematch of the previous NBA Finals in history, and the first Finals since 2008 in which the number one seed in each conference met. It was the second straight rematch in back-to-back years, as the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs played each other in 2013 and 2014. Golden State, which earned home-court advantage with setting the NBA regular season wins record (73--9), jumped to a 2--0 lead in the series while recording the largest combined margin of victory (48) through two games in NBA Finals history. Cleveland returned home and responded with a 120--90 win in Game 3, but the Warriors won Game 4 to take a 3--1 series lead. The Cavaliers won the next three games to become the first team in Finals history to successfully overcome a 3--1 deficit. It also marked the first time since 1978 that Game 7 was won by the road team. The win by the Cavaliers was the first major professional sports championship won by a team based in Cleveland since 1964, and the first-ever championship won by the Cavaliers franchise. NBA Finals MVP winner LeBron James propelled the Cavaliers to the historic comeback. For the first time since 2004, a new scheduling format was instituted for the Finals. In previous years, the Finals were played in a Thursday--Sunday--Tuesday scheme. However, the league changed its scheduling to ensure an extra day off for both teams, which have to travel from one city to another during the series. This, along with the designated travel day, took place after Games 2, 4, 5, and 6.

This would also be the sixth consecutive NBA Finals appearance for LeBron James, the most for any player not part of the 1960s Boston Celtics, and the fifth for James Jones (who technically qualified for the 2011 NBA Finals along with James, but did not play). Despite holding the best record in the Eastern Conference at 30--11 midway through the season on January 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired head coach David Blatt. Associate head coach Tyronn Lue was then promoted to replace Blatt. General Manager David Griffin cited ``a lack of fit with our personnel and our vision'' as the reason for Blatt's firing. Cleveland finished the regular season with a 57--25 record, capturing the Central Division title and the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. They then advanced to the Finals after sweeping both the Detroit Pistons in the first round and the Atlanta Hawks in the second round, and defeating the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games. The Cavaliers were the first team in history to go to two consecutive NBA Finals with rookie head coaches. Golden State Warriors (edit) Main article: 2015--16 Golden State Warriors season This was the defending NBA Champions Golden State Warriors 'second consecutive trip to the NBA Finals and eighth overall. The Warriors broke the record set by the 1995--96 Chicago Bulls by finishing the regular season with a 73--9 record. In addition, the Warriors broke numerous other NBA records, including most road wins (34), best start to a season (24--0) and longest regular-season home win streak (54 dating back to the 2014--15 season). They also became the first team to make over1,000 three-pointers in the regular-season with1,077, eclipsing the previous record of 933 set by the 2014--15 Houston Rockets. The Warriors were led by Stephen Curry, who was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. The Splash Brothers twosome of Curry and Klay Thompson were the highest scoring duo in the league, combining to average 52.2 points per game. Head coach Steve Kerr missed the first 43 regular season games because of a back injury. Assistant coach Luke Walton served as interim head coach during Kerr's absence and he led the Warriors to a 39--4 start. In the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round and the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals in five games each. In Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 96--88, becoming only the 10th team in NBA history to overcome a 3--1 series deficit, and advancing to a second straight NBA Finals for the first time since 1947 and 1948.

James and Irving each scored 41 points to become the first teammates in Finals history to score 40 or more in the same game. James also added 16 rebounds. After Game 4, Green was assessed a Flagrant Foul 1 for his contact with James that was ruled ``unnecessary'' and ``retaliatory'', and James was given a technical foul for taunting. Having accumulated his fourth flagrant foul point in the playoffs, Green was suspended for Game 5, becoming the first player to be suspended from playing in a Finals game since Jerry Stackhouse in 2006. Green watched the game from a luxury box in the nearby Oakland Alameda Coliseum, where the Oakland Athletics were also playing a game at the same time, hosting the Texas Rangers. Warriors center Andrew Bogut suffered a season-ending injury to his left knee in the second half when he jumped to block a layup attempt by Cavs guard J.R. Smith and came down awkwardly on Smith.

The Cavaliers scored the game's first eight points en route to outscoring the Warriors 31--11 after one quarter. Golden State rallied to trim Cleveland's lead as low as eight points on a couple of occasions before the Cavs settled for a 59--43 halftime lead. In the second half, Cleveland continued to extend their lead and tied the series. LeBron James led all scorers with 41 points with 11 assists. Kyrie Irving added 23 points for the Cavs, while Tristan Thompson had 16 rebounds for the Cavaliers. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 30 points, while drilling six threes. Klay Thompson added 25 points for the Warriors. Back from suspension, Green was held to eight points on 3--7 shooting. James scored 18 straight points for Cleveland from the end of the third quarter to the 7: 00 mark of the fourth. Late in the game with the Cavaliers up by 13, he blocked a Curry shot from behind, and afterward had some words for him. With 4: 22 left, Curry received his sixth foul and fouled out of the game. He then threw his mouthpiece into the stands in frustration, resulting in a technical foul and his ejection from the game. Curry was the first MVP to foul out of an NBA Finals game since ShaquilleO'Neal in 2000. The Cavaliers became the third team to fall behind 3--1 and force Game 7 (and the first in 50 years). James was the first player to have consecutive 40-point games in the finals since, coincidentally, ShaquilleO'Neal in the 2000 Finals. Following the game, Curry and Warriors head coach Steve Kerr were fined$25,000 each for their actions and public officiating criticism.

F/ C 9 Channing Frye DNP Head coach: Tyronn Lue Game 7 (edit) This season's Finals marked the first time in NBA history in which both teams entered game 7 after accumulating exactly the same total points scored after game 6 (610 points each). The Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 93--89 in Game 7 to win the series 4--3. Game 7 was a close game, with 20 lead changes and 11 ties. This was the only game in the entire series to have a final margin of fewer than 10 points. At halftime, the Warriors were ahead 49--42. In the second half, the Cavaliers outscored the Warriors 51--40 as the Warriors failed to score a basket during the last 4: 39 of the game. In the closing minutes of the 4th quarter LeBron James delivered what became known as ``The Block'' on a layup attempt by Andre Iguodala with the score tied at 89 and 01: 50 remaining in the game. Kyrie Irving made a go-ahead 3-point field goal over the NBA's first unanimous regular season MVP Stephen Curry to give Cleveland a 92--89 lead with 0: 53 remaining in the game. Before Kyrie Irving's 3-point field goal both teams were tied at 699 points scored apiece in this series. Immediately after Irving's three, Golden State brought the ball up-court, opting not to call a timeout, and although Golden State got a preferred switch and matchup of Curry on Kevin Love, Love made arguably ``the biggest defensive stop of the entire NBA season'', and forced Curry into a contested 3-pointer, which he missed. After LeBron hurt his right wrist being fouled on a dunk attempt, he nearly clinched the title for the Cavaliers by making one of two free throws, bringing the clock down to 10.6 seconds left. After the Cavaliers fouled Draymond Green with 6.5 seconds remaining, Stephen Curry received the inbounds pass, pump faked and shot a three pointer over Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert. The attempt missed, and was rebounded by Marreese Speights of the Warriors who attempted a three pointer as time expired and missed. Love immediately hugged the Finals MVP LeBron James. Draymond Green led all scorers with 32 points, including 6 of 8 from three-point range to go along with 15 rebounds and 9 assists. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson added 17 and 14 points, respectively. LeBron James led all Cavaliers with 27 points and became only the 3rd player ever in NBA history to record a triple double in an NBA Finals Game 7 by adding 11 assists and 11 rebounds. Kyrie Irving added 26 points for Cleveland. The Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3--1 series deficit to win the NBA Finals. They became the first NBA Champion to clinch all their playoff series on the road since the 1999 San Antonio Spurs, as well as the first road team to win a Finals Game 7 since the 1978 Washington Bullets. The Cavaliers won their first championship in franchise history, ending a nearly 52-year pro sports championship drought for the city of Cleveland. LeBron James was named the unanimous Finals MVP, becoming the only the fifth player in NBA history to earn the award at least thrice. He also was the overall leader in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks during the series, a feat that had never before been accomplished in any NBA playoff series. Tyronn Lue became the 14th coach to win an NBA championship as a head coach and player. After 13 years, James had finally brought a championship to the city of Cleveland. On July 13, 2016, Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals received the 2016 ESPY award for Best Game. This loss led the Warriors to pursue Kevin Durant when he became a free agent that summer signing him on July 4.

Headquarters in Downtown Austin Type Subsidiary Industry Grocery store Health food store Founded September 20, 1980; 36 years ago (1980-09-20) Austin, Texas, U.S. Founders John Mackey, Renee Hardy-Lawson, Mark Skiles, Craig Weller Key people John B. Elstrott (Chairman) John Mackey (CEO) Jason Buechel (CIO) Owner Amazon.com Number of employees91,000 Subsidiaries 365 By Whole Foods Market Website www.wholefoodsmarket.com Whole Foods Market Inc. is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats. The precursors of Whole Foods were John Mackey and Renee Hardy Lawson's SaferWay store, founded in 1978, and Craig Weller and Mark Skiles 'Clarksville Natural Grocery, both in Austin, Texas. On September 20, 1980, these stores merged to open the first Whole Foods Market Store, also in Austin, the company's current headquarters. In the 1990s, Whole Foods bought a series of organic food chain competitors, including Wellspring and Freshfield's, quickly cementing its position as the highest-volume seller of organic food in the United States. As of September 2015, it has91,000 employees and 431 supermarkets in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and has its main produce procurement office in Watsonville, California. As of 2015, founder John Mackey and Walter Robb wereco-CEOs of the publicly traded company, with John Elstrott as chairman. In November 2016, the company announced that Walter Robb would be stepping down asco-CEO at the end of year and would remain with the company as a director. It became a Fortune 500 company in March 2005 and is the 30th largest retailer in the U.S., based on 2014 revenue. On June 16, 2017, it was announced that Amazon.com would acquire Whole Foods for$13.7 billion at$42 per share, a 27 percent premium to its previous closing price. Following the conclusion of the deal at the end of 2017, Whole Foods will become a subsidiary of Amazon, widely expanding Amazon's presence as a physical retailer. On August 23, 2017, it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger between Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market. The following day it was announced that the deal would be closed on August 28, 2017.

When the two were evicted from their apartment for storing food products in it, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher. Two years later, John Mackey and Renee Lawson partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with the latter's Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market, which included meat products. At10,500 square feet (980 m) and with a staff of 19, the store was quite large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time. The following Memorial Day, on May 25, 1981, the most damaging flood in 70 years devastated Austin. Whole Foods 'inventory was ruined, and most of the equipment was damaged. The loss was approximately$400,000 and Whole Foods Market had no insurance. Customers, neighbors, and staff pitched in to repair and clean up the damage. Creditors, vendors, and investors assisted in helping the store recover, and the store reopened 28 days later. Expansion (edit) The Whole Foods Market on Bowery, in Manhattan, is the largest grocery store in New York City. The produce department of a new Whole Foods Market located in the Southern Hills area of Tulsa, OK. Whole Foods Market in Boston A Bread& Circus and Whole Foods bakery Beginning in 1984, Whole Foods Market expanded out of Austin, first to Houston and Dallas and then into New Orleans with the purchase of The Whole Food Co. in 1988. In 1989, the company expanded to the West Coast with a store in Palo Alto, Calif. While opening new stores, the company fueled rapid growth by acquiring other natural foods chains throughout the 1990s: Wellspring Grocery of North Carolina, Bread& Circus of Massachusetts and Rhode Island (banner retired in 2003), Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Markets of Los Angeles, Bread of Life of Northern California, Fresh Fields Markets on the East Coast and in the Midwest, Florida Bread of Life stores, Detroit-area Merchant of Vino stores, and Nature's Heartland of Boston. The company's 100th store was opened in Torrance, California, in 1999. The company started its third decade with additional acquisitions. The first was Natural Abilities in 2000, which did business as Food for Thought in Northern California. After the departure of then company president Chris Hitt and regional president Rich Cundiff, Southern California region, John Mackey promoted A.C. Gallo, president of the Northeast region and Walter Robb, president of the Northern California region toCo-COO and soon after added the titles ofCo-President. This led to the promotion of three new regional presidents and a new era for the company. David Lannon became president of the Northeast region, Anthony Gilmore became president of the Southwest region, Ron Megehan became president of the Northern California region. In 2001, Whole Foods also moved into Manhattan. Later that year Ken Meyer became president of the newly formed South region and Whole Foods Market acquired the assets of Harry's Farmers Market, which included three stores in Atlanta. In 2002, the company continued its expansion in North America and opened its first store in Toronto, Ontario. Further continuing its expansion, Select Fish of Seattle was acquired in 2003. In 2005, Whole Foods opened its80,000 sq ft (7,400 m) flagship store in downtown Austin. The company's headquarters moved into offices above the store. Whole Foods Market's expansion has increased the need for products and processing plants. In response, the company added its 365 Everyday Value product line and purchased Allegro Coffee Company in 1997. It also began to acquire seafood processing plants in 2003. Whole Foods began opening its Hawaii stores in 2007 and in 2008 it opened a southeast distribution center in Braselton, Georgia, calling it the first ``green distribution center'' for the company. Along with new acquisitions, such as the 2014 purchase of seven Dominick's Finer Foods locations in Chicago, Whole Foods has also sold stores to other companies. For example, 35 Henry's Farmers Market and Sun Harvest Market stores were sold to a subsidiary of Los Angeles grocer Smart& Final Inc. for$166 million in 2007. Whole Foods plans to open its second store in upstate New York in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo. As part of a streamlining campaign, in January 2017 the company reported that it would close three remaining regional kitchens in Everett, Landover and Atlanta. United Kingdom and Canada (edit) In 2004, Whole Foods Market entered the U.K. by acquiring seven Fresh& Wild stores. In June 2007, it opened its first full-size store, a total of80,000 sq ft (7,400 m) on three levels, on the site of the old Barkers department store on Kensington High Street, West London. Company executives claimed that as many as forty stores might eventually be opened throughout the U.K. However, by September 2008, in the wake of Whole Foods Market's financial troubles, Fresh& Wild had been reduced to four stores, all in London. The flagship Bristol branch closed because it had ``not met profitability goals''. In the year to September 28, 2008, the UK subsidiary lost\u00a3 36M due to a large impairment charge of\u00a3 27M and poor trading results due to the growing fears of global recession. However, in 2011, global sales grew+ 8% each financial quarter as shoppers returned to the chain. A first Scottish store was opened on November 16, 2011 in Giffnock, a suburb of Glasgow. Whole Foods Market Inc. currently operates 9 different Whole Foods locations: in Camden Town, Cheltenham, Clapham Junction, Giffnock, Kensington, Piccadilly Circus, Richmond, Stoke Newington, and Fulham. Whole Foods entered the Canadian market in 2002 in Toronto. In 2013, Whole Foods said it would open around 40 more stores in Canada over time. At the time, there were 9 Whole Foods in Canada. By January 2017, Whole Foods had 467 stores, all of which were in the United States except 9 in the United Kingdom and 12 in Canada. In January 2017, Whole Foods announced it was cancelling plans from 2015 and 2016 to open stores in Calgary and Edmonton. Among the twelve were five in the Vancouver and Toronto areas, one in Ottawa, and one in Victoria, British Columbia. Acquisition of Wild Oats Markets and antitrust complaint (edit) On February 21, 2007, Whole Foods Market, Inc. and Wild Oats Markets Inc. announced the signing of a merger agreement under which Whole Foods Market, Inc. would acquire Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s outstanding common stock in a cash tender offer of$18.50 per share, or approximately$565 million based on fully diluted shares. Under the agreement, Whole Foods Market, Inc. would also assume Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s existing net debt totaling approximately$106 million as reported on September 30, 2006. On June 27, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint challenging Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc. According to the complaint, the FTC believed that the proposed transaction would violate federal antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between two close competitors in the operation of premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide. The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to vigorously oppose the FTC's complaint and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007. CEO John Mackey started a blog on the subject to explain his opposition to the FTC's stance. Further blogging by Mackey was revealed when the FTC released papers detailing highly opinionated comments under the pseudonym ``Rahodeb'' that he made to the Whole Foods Yahoo! investment message board. This became the subject of an investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that Regulation Fair Disclosure law of 2000 may have been violated. The SEC cleared Mackey of the charges on April 25, 2008. On July 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the district court's decision allowing the merger. The Court of Appeals ruled that ``premium natural, and organic supermarkets'' (``PNOS''), such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats, constitute a distinct submarket of all grocers. The court ruled that ``mission driven'' consumers (those with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility) would be adversely affected by the merger because substantial evidence by the FTC showed that Whole Foods intended to raise prices after consummation of the merger. As part of its effort to combat the ruling, Whole Foods subpoenaed financial records, market studies and future strategic plans belonging to New Seasons Market, a regional competitor based in the Portland area. In 2009 Whole Foods agreed to sell the Wild Oats chain. Recent (edit) In February 2017, Whole Foods Market Inc. said it would close nine of its stores and lowered its financial projections for the year, moves made as the natural-foods company struggled with increased competition and slowing sales growth. In late April 2017, Whole Foods reported their sixth consecutive quarters of declining sales and announced that the company would be closing nine stores: two each in Colorado and California, and one each in Georgia, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and Chicago, Illinois. The loss of revenue was attributed to foot traffic being down and other supermarkets offering a similar experience for a lower cost. Wikinews has related news: Amazon.com to acquire Whole Foods at US$42 per share On April 24, 2017, it was reported that Albertsons was in preliminary talks with bankers about bidding to purchase Whole Foods. Albertsons at the time was owned by Cerberus Capital Management. On June 15, 2017, Amazon.com announced it would acquire Whole Foods Market, adding 400 physical stores to Amazon'se-commerce assets. The purchase was valued at$13.7 billion, and caused Whole Foods stock prices to soar after the announcement was made. Product quality (edit) Produce in a Cary, North Carolina store Whole Foods Market only sells products that meet its self-created quality standards for being ``natural'', which the store defines as: minimally processed foods that are free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, and many others as listed on their online ``Unacceptable Food Ingredients'' list. Whole Foods Market has also announced that it does not intend to sell meat or milk from cloned animals or their offspring, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled them safe to eat. The company also sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible. Stores do not carry foie gras or eggs from hens confined to battery cages due to animal cruelty concerns, as a result of successful advocacy by animal welfare groups. The Whole Foods Market website details the company's criteria for selling food, dietary supplements, and personal care products. Until June 2011, body care products sold at Whole Foods Market could be marketed as organic even if they contained ingredients not listed by the USDA as acceptable for use in organic food. ``Products made using petroleum-derived and other synthetic or chemical ingredients, prohibited in organic foods, can be found among the organic shampoos and lotions made by Avalon, Nature's Gate, Jason Natural Cosmetics, Kiss My Face and other brands'', said Urvashi Rangan, an environmental health scientist at Consumer Reports. This is because the federal guidelines that regulate organic food labeling do not apply to cosmetics. Starting in June 2011, personal care products sold at Whole Foods Market were required to follow the same USDA National Organic Program standards for organic food. This required products labeled ``Organic'' to contain 95 percent or more certified organic ingredients. Preparing to break open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese at Whole Foods Market in Overland Park, Kansas In a Wall Street Journal article in August 2009, John Mackey acknowledged that his company had lost touch with its natural food roots and would attempt to reconnect with the idea that health was affected by the quality of food consumed. He said ``We sell a bunch of junk''. He stated that the company would focus more on health education in its stores. As of 2013, many stores have employed Healthy Eating Specialists which are team members who ``answer customers 'healthy eating questions and can assist... in choosing the most nutrient-dense ingredients, suggest satisfying healthy recipes,'' and help ``create a meal plan in keeping with your health goals.'' Rating systems (edit) In an effort to allow their customers full-transparency in purchasing Whole Foods Market has developed a number of in-store rating systems for various departments. The Seafood department has a Sustainability Rating System for wild-caught seafood while farm-raised seafood has to meet aquaculture standards both rated in accordance to third-party auditors. The Meat department has a rating system in partnership with the Global Animal Partnership based on animal welfare. The produce department has a rating system based on farming practices which include measures of a farm's environmental, GMO transparency, worker safety and wage practices. The grocery department has anEco-scale rating system for its cleaning products which measures their environmental impact. Each system is in place to allow customers to make the most educated choices within Whole Foods Market. There are efforts to create more rating systems in other departments. GMO transparency (edit) Continuing with their efforts of full-transparency, Whole Foods Market is committed to becoming the first national grocer to provide its customers GMO (genetically modified organism) product labeling by 2018. Efforts of GMO transparency run the gamut of each department. For years,Non-GMO Project Verified items have been sought in Grocery. While efforts continue in Produce, Whole Foods recommends buying organic or referring to their ``Responsibly Grown produce rating system (which) requires growers to disclose use of GMO seeds or plant material.'' In Seafood, plans are being made to launch aNon-GMO Project Verification process for farm-raised fish. Currently, there are no USDA Organic regulations for farmed seafood. Meanwhile, Whole Foods provides a GMO Fact guide including lists of top GMO crops, packaged foods containing GMOs and other products commonly made with GMO plants. Shopping tips to avoid buying potential GMO products at Whole Foods Market are also included in the guide. Currently, the company offers30,000 certified organic items and about13,500Non-GMO Project Verified products. Purchasing (edit) Whole Foods Market has opened wine and beer shops to cater to their upmarket brand. Above, the imported beer case at a Whole Foods beer shop. Orange Juice at Whole Foods Market Whole Foods Market purchases products for retail sale from local, regional, and international wholesale suppliers and vendors. The majority of purchasing occurs at the regional and national levels to negotiate volume discounts with major vendors and distributors. Regional and store buyers are focused on local products and any unique products necessary to ensure a neighborhood market feel in the stores. Whole Foods says that the company is committed to buying from local producers that meet its quality standards while also increasingly focusing more of their purchasing on producer-and manufacture-direct programs. Some regions have an employee known as a ``forager'', whose sole duty is to source local products for each store. National organic program (edit) Whole Foods is the first grocer in the United States to have certified adherence to National Organic Program standards; which involves monitoring products from the time they reach stores until they are placed in a shopping cart. Whole Trade Guarantee (edit) In April 2007, Whole Foods Market launched the Whole Trade Guarantee, a purchasing initiative emphasizing ethics and social responsibility concerning products imported from the developing world. The criteria include fair prices for crops, environmentally sound practices, better wages and labor conditions for workers and the stipulation that one percent of proceeds from Whole Trade certified products go to the Whole Planet Foundation to supportmicro-loan programs in developing countries. The company's goal, published in 2007, is to have at least half of its imported products from these countries fully certified by 2017. Efforts (edit) Whole Foods Market has a policy of donating at least five percent of its annual net profits to charitable causes. Some of this mandate is accomplished through store level donations held on certain ``5% days'' throughout the year. The rest of it comes from various targeted projects by the company. Environmental involvement (edit) In May 1999, Whole Foods Market joined the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a global independent, not-for-profit organization promoting sustainable fisheries and responsible fishing practices worldwide to help preserve fish stocks for future generations. The company first began selling MSC-certified seafood in 2000, and a growing selection of MSC-certified fish continues to be available. Whole Foods placed third on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's list of the ``Top 25 Green Power Partners''. The company also received the EPA Green Power Award in 2004 and 2005 and Partner of the Year award in 2006 and 2007. A January 8, 2007, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report listed Whole Foods Market as the second-highest purchaser of green power nationwide, citing its actions as helping drive the development of new renewable energy sources for the electricity generation. The EPA report showed Whole Foods Market using 463.1 million kilowatt hours annually. It was covered, 100 percentnet-wise, by its total electricity from biomass, geothermal, small-hydro, solar, and wind sources. Whole Foods signed an agreement with SolarCity to install solar panels on up to 100 stores. Eliminating plastic (edit) In January 2008, Whole Foods Market was the first U.S. supermarket to commit to completely eliminating disposable plastic grocery bags to help protect the environment and conserve resources and many stores serve as a collection point for shoppers to recycle their plastic bags. On Earth Day, April 22, 2008, Whole Foods Market eliminated the use of disposable plastic grocery bags company-wide in favor of reusable bags or paper bags made from recycled paper. The company also began offering ``Better Bags'', a large and colorful grocery bag made primarily from recycled bottles. The move from the traditional paper/ plastic system to environmentally friendly and reusable bags has been packaged as an initiative the company calls ``BYOB--Bring Your Own Bag''. The campaign is aimed at reducing pollution by eliminating plastic bags and reducing waste by encouraging bag reuse with ``bag refunds'' of 5--10 cents, depending on the store. Humane treatment of animals (edit) In 2002, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals began petitioning Whole Foods to take steps to ensure the improvement of treatment of animals sold in the stores. Whole Foods created the Animal Compassion Foundation in January 2005, a separate nonprofit organization, to help other producers evolve their practices to raise animals naturally and humanely. According to Whole Foods Natural Meat Quality Standards and Animal Compassionate Standards, pulling feathers from live ducks, bill trimming, bill heat treatment, toe punching, slitting the webs of the feet, and toe removal are all prohibited in the raising of ducks for Whole Foods Market. Any ducks treated in this manner, treated with antibiotics or antimicrobials, cloned, genetically modified, or not allowed medical treatment when necessary are to be removed from Whole Foods Market stock. Toxins (edit) In January 2004, in California, the Environmental Working Group and the Center for Environmental Health presented a notice of intent to file ananti-toxin lawsuit against salmon producers. This was in large part due to Whole Foods 'involvement, including highlighting companies 'failure to warn consumers the fish contained potentially dangerous levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs. In February 2006, Shareholders of Whole Foods filed a resolution asking Whole Foods to report toxic chemicals found in its products. Substances such as Bisphenol A (BPA), found in products such as baby bottles and children's cups, are controversial. Whole Foods no longer sells baby bottles and children's cups made with BPA. In the wake of concern over the safety of seafood imports from China, on July 10, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Whole Foods imports a small amount of frozen shrimp from China, accounting for less than 2% of the company's total seafood sales. A Whole Foods spokesperson addressed the issue, saying ``We're not concerned about the less than 2 percent. It's business as usual for us.'' Criticism and controversies (edit) Whole Foods Market is consideredanti-labor by most worker organizations and has been criticized that its products may not be as progressive as they are touted to be. Author Michael Pollan has contended that the supermarket chain has done well in expanding the organic market, but has done so at the cost of local foods, regional producers, and distributors. Parts of the debate have taken place publicly through a series of letters between Pollan and Whole Foods Market CEO John Mackey. Whole Foods announced in June 2006 that it would stop selling live lobsters and crabs, but in February 2007 made an exception for a Portland, Maine store for its ability to meet ``humane standards''. The lobsters are kept in private compartments instead of being piled on top of one another in a tank, and employees use a device that gives them a 110-volt shock so that they are not boiled alive in a pot of water. This decision was criticized byex-lobsterman Trevor Corson as damaging a New England tradition and as removing people's connection to where their food actually comes from. Ronnie Cummins, national director of the United States Organic Consumers Association, said that Whole Foods Market simply uses the term natural as a marketing tool. Cummins concluded that ``Whole Foods Market now is a big-box retailer--and it's much more concerned about competing with the other big boxes than issues of ethics and sustainability.'' Similarly, researcher Stacy Mitchell of the New Rules Project argues that the corporation's aggressive marketing of local food is more hype than substance. Whole Foods has frequently been the subject of resistance or boycotts in response to proposed store locations. The corporation has also been criticized for its aggressive policy of promoting its own in-house brands (e.g. 365) at the expense of smaller or local independent brands. On August 11, 2009, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey published an editorial in The Wall Street Journal criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the editorial was controversial in the natural foods community. The company has created other controversies at various times involving business practices, labor issues, product selection, and failure to support farmers and suppliers. In January 2011, they were criticized by the Organic Consumers Association for ``surrendering'' to agriculture companies such as Monsanto by selling GMO foods; in March 2013, Whole Foods promised to label GMO-containing products in North American stores by 2018. The company has drawn criticism for questionable science behind the claims of benefit of its products, including encouraging and selling drugs that are described to work under homeopathic principles despite the fact that homeopathy is pseudoscience. In 2013, two workers in Albuquerque, New Mexico were suspended for speaking Spanish. The resulting investigation revealed that Whole Foods has a policy of speaking ``English to customers and other Team Members while on the clock''. The company soon revised its policy. The company later agreed to pay an$800,000 settlement in response to allegations that its California stores were charging more per weight than what its labels indicated. Whole Foods continued this practice despite the settlement, with investigators alleging thousands of continued violations well into 2015. In 2015, the CEOs made a public admission of this happening in New York after a New York City Department of Consumer Affairs investigation. Whole Foods has faced lawsuits in California over the presence of carcinogens. In March 2008, following a study by the Organic Consumers Association, reports of high levels of 1, 4-Dioxane found in body care products at Whole Foods, prompted the Attorney General of California to file a lawsuit against the company for a violation of Proposition 65. Civil penalties of up to$2,500 a day were expected to be awarded. The action claimed that 365 along with brands sold by other cosmetic companies did not include a label warning about the chemical. Spokesperson Libba Letton stated that the company did ``not believe that these products represent a health risk or are in excess of California's Proposition 65 Safe Harbor level for 1, 4-Dioxane'' while consumer activist David Steinman urged them ``to stop treating the inclusion of cancer-causing chemicals in their products as 'business as usual '''. Proposition 65 was invoked again in 2013 when the state sued Whole Foods and other retailers over the presence of lead in certain candies. In May 2014, Whole Foods launched a pilot program to sell rabbit meat in 5 of its 12 market regions. Because domestic rabbits are the eighth most common pet in the United States as well as an animal rescued and sheltered alongside cats and dogs, this decision triggered a nationwide boycott of Whole Foods by the vegetarian activist House Rabbit Society and their supporters. In June 2014 Whole Foods awarded a financial grant to Oz Family Farms, a family-owned rabbit meat business. In January 2015, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released a video of laying hens from a Northern California farm that supplies eggs to Whole Foods. In the video, which featured footage of crowded, dirty henhouses and injured birds, DxE contended that the hens 'welfare was severely compromised, even though numerous boards had labeled the farm as ``Certified Humane''. In 2015, animal rights groups People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Direct Action Everywhere released investigations criticizing Whole Foods animal welfare standards and accusing Whole Foods suppliers of animal cruelty. After the release of its investigation, PETA reversed its previous support for Whole Foods 'animal welfare rating system, writing that ``Under the guise of compassion, Whole Foods is profiting from violence against animals.'' PETAco-founder Ingrid Newkirk criticized Whole Foods 'animal welfare approach based on the DxE and PETA investigations, arguing that supposed welfare failures indicate a need for animal rights rather than welfare. Whole Foods has come under harsh criticism from abolitionist vegans such as Gary L. Francione who view the company's policies as a betrayal of the animal rights position. In June 2016, US food safety inspectors warned the company that violations discovered at Whole Foods 'Everett, Massachusetts plant could result in food being ``contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.'' Whole Foodsre-zoning petition regarding protected wetlands (edit) In January 2016, SJ Collins Enterprises, a developer who often works with Whole Foods, petitioned the Sarasota County board of county commissioners to allow the removal a 5-acre protected wetlands so that they could build a surface parking lot for a planned Whole Foods shopping center and Wawa gas station at the intersection of University Parkway and Honore Avenue. The county commission voted 4--1 to allow there-zoning and accept 41 acres of replacement wetlands. The lone commissioner voting against the proposal, Charles Hines, stated that approval of the petition could create a domino effect leading to the destruction of other protected areas. He also referred to discussions with county staff members before the commission during the deliberation, such as senior manager Matt Osterhoudt, confirming the health and function of the wetlands and the staff assessment that the comprehensive plan of the county did not allow for the destruction of a wetlands in that condition. Commentators beginning with Tom Lyons responded by expressing their outrage. Awards and recognition (edit) Whole Foods Market has been included in Fortune magazine's annual list of the ``100 Best Companies to Work For'' every year since the list's inception in 1998, most recently at number 44 in 2014. The chain has also won a number of awards for social responsibility including a first-place ranking by Harris Interactive/ The Wall Street Journal in 2006 and past spots on the ``100 Best Corporate Citizens'' list published by Corporate Responsibility Officer. In 2014, Supermarket News ranked Whole Foods number 19 on its list of ``Top 75 North American Retailers'' and British trade magazine The Grocer named it the ``World's Greatest Food Retailer'' in 2006. A Whole Foods Market in Markham, Ontario. Labor relations andanti-union activity (edit) Among its core values, the company lists ``supporting team member happiness and excellence''. The company maintains that its treatment of workers obviates the need for labor unions: At its U.S. stores, after 800 service hours, full-time workers are given an option to purchase health insurance coverage starting at$20 per paycheck for themselves, and spouse and dependent coverage for an additional charge. Workers also have access to a company-funded personal wellness account, and the starting pay at most stores is highly competitive. Whole Foods Market suburban store in Redwood City, California Whole Food's health insurance plan is notable for its high deductibles--$2000 for general medical expenses, and$1000 for prescriptions. However, employees receive$300 to$1800 per year (depending on years of service) in personal wellness funds. Once an employee has met the deductibles, insurance covers 80% of general medical costs and prescriptions but not for any type of mental illness. CEO Mackey drew attention to the insurance program (offered through United Health Care in the US) for its employees in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. In the article he called his company's insurance plan a viable alternative to ``Obamacare''. Mackey summed up his antipathy toward universal coverage in his op-ed by stating: A careful reading of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will not reveal any intrinsic right to health care, food or shelter. That's because there isn't any. This ``right'' has never existed in America. A ``Boycott Whole Foods'' page on Facebook was created in response to John Mackey's position on health care. Mackey, a libertarian, believes that unions facilitate an adversarial relationship between management and labor. An attempt at unionizing in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2002 was met with resistance from store management and Whole Foods was accused by labor activists of union busting. Employees at the Madison store voted in favor of unionization. Whole Foods then refused to bargain with their employees. After a year, the company moved to decertify the union. Further attempts at unionizing Whole Foods Market stores have been unsuccessful. Whole Foods launched a nationwide campaign, requiring workers to attend ``Union Awareness Training,'' complete with Power Point presentations. Whole Foods was criticized for its refusal to support a campaign by the United Farm Workers (UFW) on behalf of agricultural workers laboring on strawberry farms. During the late 1990s, the UFW persuaded several large supermarket chains to sign a pledge in support of improved wages and working conditions for strawberry pickers. Whole Foods chose instead to support the farm workers indirectly by holding a ``National 5% Day'' where five percent of that day's sales--$125,000--was donated to organizations which provide social services to farmworkers. On September 28, 2015, Whole Foods announced layoffs of1,500 jobs, which is 1.6 percent of its workforce, in an effort to lower prices. The eliminated jobs would come from regional and store positions over the next two months. Management system (edit) Employee structure and culture (edit) Whole Foods Market consists of twelve geographic regions, each with its own president, regional administrative team, store-level leadership, and store-level team members. A 4-tier hierarchy of employment exists within the Whole Foods Company: Store Employment, Facilities Employment, Regional Offices, and Global Headquarters. Employee Benefits and incentives (edit) To help employees learn about products, the company has instituted a mentoring program and developed an online portal called ``Whole Foods Market University'' to aid in training. Internal parlance refers to ``team leaders'' as opposed to ``managers'' and stores sometimes offer prizes for competing teams. A 2014 analysis of 2012 figures found that Whole Foods Market was ``among the least generous companies'' in terms of its 401 (k) savings program. Whole Foods Market has an employee discount; while all employees are provided a standard base discount rate of 20% on all store purchases, higher rates, up to 30% can be earned based upon employee physical fitness health tests that are given yearly. These fitness exams are taken at the option of the employee. Company structure (edit) In total, Whole Foods Market is composed of seventeen companies, each specializing in a different product. In the 1990s, while new stores were being opened, other natural food chain stores were being acquired for horizontal integration. This led to the Federal Trade Commission challenging the eventual merger with Wild Oats on the basis that it violated antitrust laws, essentially eliminating competition and inflating prices in the health foods market. Subsidiary companies and suppliers (edit) Whole Foods Market is based on a system of decentralized buying. Each vendor is approved at the regional level for corporate standards such as beingnon-gmo and Fair Trade. Individual stores then decide which approved products to stock. They have a rolling ten-year distribution arrangement with UNFI. 365 by Whole Foods Market (edit) 365 by Whole Foods Market Industry Retail groceries Founded June 2015; 2 years ago (2015-06) Number of locations 5 (August 2017) Parent Whole Foods Market Website 365bywfm.com In June 2015, the company announced a millennial-focused, and more affordable version of its regular stores, called ``365 By Whole Foods Market''. In addition to using digital price tags, in-store communication will largely be done through a smartphone app. In addition, the stores will have the goal of zero waste, donating all leftover food and using LED lights, as well as carbon dioxide-powered refrigeration cases. Jeff Turnas is president of the division. To cut costs, customers unload bulkier products directly off a pallet. Some items, like produce, are priced per item instead of by weight. For items that are still sold by weight, the customers weigh, barcode, and tag those items before they reach the check-out counter. Unlike the regular stores, the 365 stores offer a rewards program. The first 365 By Whole Foods Market store opened in May 2016 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. A second location opened two months later in Lake Oswego, Oregon, followed by a third store two months after that in Bellevue, Washington. In April 2017, a fourth location opened in Cedar Park, Texas. In August 2017, a fifth location was opened in Santa Monica, California. Other future locations include stores in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Georgia, and Florida. Although there were as many as twenty two 365 stores under various stages of construction by early July 2017, progress at most of these construction sites have come to a halt upon the news of the possible acquisition of the parent company by Amazon and there is no information if and when the construction at any of the building sites would resume. In reviewing the new retail format, a reporter for The Motley Fool wrote that the new stores were ``closer to a combination of a fruit stand, convenience store, and a restaurant than a traditional grocery store'' while a MarketWatch reporter called them ``hipster havens'' due to their use of high tech as a cost cutting and efficiency measure. Most reviews were very positive although a few customers said that they miss talking to a person when placing food orders via tablets.

John Mackey, the company's chairman, likes to say, ``There's no inherent reason why business can not be ethical, socially responsible, and profitable.'' And under the umbrella creed of ``sustainability'', Whole Foods pays its workers a solid living wage--its lowest earners starting at$10.00 per hour and after several years of employment average$13.15 an hour. Although Mackey's stance on unions, as well as employment benefits as well as a substantial wage, there is, however two sides two the coin as ``Team Members'' could potentially be terminated for the most minimal things, such as having a bad day. Leadership at times has overly high expectations and has no human emotion, people skills and thinks of little mistakes as crucial grounds for termination. Whole Foods Market has a point policy with its employees where it is understood and advocated that this point policy effects everyone equally, but in reality it is up to leadership as to how much they want to enforce it.-- Jump up^ Mokhiber, Russell (2009-09-25). ``Boycott Whole Foods''.

And Then There Were None Cover of first UK 1939 edition by Stephen Bellman with original title Author Agatha Christie Original title Ten Little Niggers Country United Kingdom Language English Genre Mystery, crime, psychological thriller Horror Publisher Collins Crime Club Publication date 6 November 1939 Pages 272 Preceded by Murder Is Easy Followed by Sad Cypress Website And Then There Were None And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by English writer Agatha Christie, her best selling novel and described by her as the most difficult of her books to write. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as Ten Little Niggers, after the British blackface song, which serves as a major plot point. The US edition was released in January 1940 with the title And Then There Were None. All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, which is taken from the last five words of the song. It is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time. Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.

Each has an invitation tailored to his or her personal circumstances, such as an offer of employment or an unexpected late summer holiday. They are met by Thomas and Ethel Rogers, the butler and cook-housekeeper, who state that their hosts, Mr Ulick Norman Owen and his wife Mrs Una Nancy Owen, whom they have not yet met in person, have not arrived, but left instructions, which strikes all the guests as odd. A framed copy of a nursery rhyme, ``Ten Little Niggers'' (called ``Ten Little Indians'' or ``Ten Little Soldiers'' in later editions), hangs in every guest's room, and ten figurines sit on the dining room table. After supper, a gramophone (or ``phonograph'') record is played; the recording describes each visitor in turn, accuses each of having committed murder but escaping justice, and then asks if any of ``the accused'' wishes to offer a defence. All but Anthony Marston and Philip Lombard deny the charges, and Miss Brent refuses to discuss the matter. They discover that none of them actually knows the Owens, and Justice Wargrave concludes that the name ``U.N. Owen'' is shorthand for ``Unknown''. After the recording, Marston finishes his drink and immediately dies from cyanide poisoning. The remaining guests notice that one of the ten figurines is now broken, and the nursery rhyme appears to reflect the manner of death (``One choked his little self and then there were nine''). The next morning, Mrs Rogers 'corpse is found in her bed; she had died in her sleep from an overdose of chloral hydrate. By lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead, from a heavy blow to his head. Two more figurines are found to be broken, and again the deaths parallel the rhyme. Miss Brent relates the account of the gramophone charge against her to Vera Claythorne, who later tells the others. A search for Mr Owen shows that nobody else is on the island except the remaining seven. The island is a ``bare rock'' with no hiding places, and no one could have arrived or left; thus, they conclude that any one of the seven remaining persons is the killer. Wargrave leads the group in determining that so far, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer. The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and after breakfast, Miss Brent is found dead in the kitchen, where she had been left alone after complaining of feeling unwell; she had been injected with potassium cyanide via a hypodermic needle. Wargrave then suggests searching all the rooms, and any potentially dangerous items they can think of are locked up. Lombard's gun is missing from his room. When Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell of seaweed left hanging from the ceiling of her room and screams; the remaining guests rush upstairs to her room. Wargrave, however, is still downstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge. Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead. That night, Lombard appears surprised when he finds his gun returned to his room. Blore catches a glimpse of someone leaving the house but loses the trail. He then discovers Armstrong is absent from his room, and the remaining three guests conclude that Armstrong must be the killer. Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stay together at all times. In the morning, they signal SOS to the mainland from outside by using a mirror and sunlight, but receive no reply. Blore then returns to the house for food by himself and is killed by a heavy bear-shaped clock statue that is pushed from Vera's window sill, crushing his skull. Vera and Lombard are now confident that Armstrong is the killer. However, shortly afterwards, the duo come upon Armstrong's body washed up on the beach. They realize that Armstrong could not have killed Blore. Panicked, each concludes the other must be the killer. Quickly regaining her composure, Vera suggests moving the doctor's body past the shore, but this is a pretext. She lifts Lombard's gun. When Lombard lunges at her to get it back, she shoots him dead. She returns to the house in a shaken dreamlike state, relieved to be alive. She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room, and a strong smell of the sea. With visions of her former lover Hugo urging her on, she adjusts the noose and kicks the chair out from under her. Two Scotland Yard officials are puzzled by the identity of UN Owen. Although they can partially reconstruct the deaths from Marston to Wargrave with the help of the victims 'diaries and a coroner's careful report, they conclude that UN Owen was one of the victims, but are unable to determine which one. The chair on which Vera stood to hang herself had been set back upright, indicating that someone was still alive on the island after her suicide, presumably the killer. Postscript from the Killer In a postscript, a fishing ship picks up a bottle inside its trawling nets; the bottle contains a written confession of the killings, which is then sent to Scotland Yard. It is not clear how long after the killings the bottle was discovered. In the confession, Justice Wargrave writes that he has long wished to set an unsolvable puzzle of murder. His victims would be of his choosing, as they were not found guilty in a trial. He explains how he tricked Dr Armstrong into helping him fake his own death under the pretext that it would help the group identify the killer. He also explains that he replaced the chair in Vera's room. Finally, he reveals how he used the gun and some elastic to ensure his own death matched the account in the guests 'diaries. Although he wished to create an unsolvable mystery, he acknowledges in the missive a ``pitiful human need'' for recognition, hence the confession. He describes how his first victim was Isaac Morris, the sleazy lawyer and drugs trafficker who anonymously purchased the island and arranged the invitations on his behalf, making nine murders and two suicides. Morris was poisoned before Wargrave departed for the island. Wargrave's intention is to stymie the police as to which person on the island was the murderer. He states that, although there are three clues that could guide the police to the correct killer, he is confident they will be unable to find them and that the mystery will remain unsolved until the confession is read. Characters (edit) The following details of the characters are based on the original novel published in England. Anthony James Marston, an amoral and irresponsible young man, killed two young children (John and Lucy Combes) while driving recklessly, for which he felt no real remorse and accepted no personal responsibility, complaining only that his driving licence had been suspended as a result. He was the first island victim. Mrs Ethel Rogers, the cook/ housekeeper and Thomas Rogers 'wife, described as a pale and ghost-like woman who walks in mortal fear. She was dominated by her bullying husband, who coerced her into agreeing to withhold the medicine of a former employer (Miss Jennifer Brady, an elderly spinster) in order that they might collect an inheritance they knew she had left them in her will. Mrs Rogers was the second victim. General John Gordon MacArthur, a retired World War I war hero, who sent his late wife's lover (a younger officer, Arthur Richmond) to his death by assigning him to a mission where it was practically guaranteed he would not survive. Leslie MacArthur had mistakenly put the wrong letters in the envelopes on one occasion when she wrote to both men at the same time. The general tells Vera that no one will leave the island alive. Thomas Rogers, the butler and Ethel Rogers 'husband. He dominated his weak-willed wife, and they killed their former elderly employer by withholding her medicine, causing the woman to die from heart failure, thus inheriting the money she bequeathed them in her will. Despite his wife's death, Rogers was still serving the others. Emily Caroline Brent, an elderly, religiously rigid, socially respectable spinster who accepted the vacation on Soldier Island largely due to financial constraints. Years earlier, she had dismissed her teenage maid, Beatrice Taylor, for becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Beatrice, who had already been rejected by her parents for the same reason, drowned herself, which Miss Brent considered an even worse sin. The murderer put a bee into the room, in addition to murder by poison. (``A bumblebee stung one...'') Dr Edward George Armstrong, a Harley Street doctor, responsible for the death of a patient, Louisa Mary Clees, after he operated on her while drunk many years earlier. William Henry Blore, a former police inspector and now a private investigator, was accused of falsifying his testimony in court for a bribe from a dangerous criminal gang, which resulted in an innocent man, James Landor, being convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Landor, who had a wife and young child, died shortly afterwards in prison. He arrived under the alias ``Davis'' from South Africa, on the island for ``security work''. His true name is revealed on the gramophone recording. He denies the accusation against him from the gramophone recording, but later admits the truth to Lombard. Philip Lombard, a soldier of fortune. Literally down to his last square meal, he comes to the island with a loaded revolver, as suggested by his invitation letter. Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths. Neither he nor Marston feels any remorse. He is the only one to theorize that UN Owen might be Wargrave, but the others reject this. He and Vera are the only victims not killed by Justice Wargrave. Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, resourceful young woman who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls 'school. Her job as a governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton. Claythorne let the boy drown so his uncle Hugo Hamilton could inherit the family estate and marry her. Hugo rejected her when he somehow realized what she had done. Justice Lawrence John Wargrave, a retired judge, known as a ``hanging judge'' for liberally awarding the death penalty in murder cases. Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton, a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman, and sentencing him to death unfairly. As the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard, new evidence after Seton's execution proved Seton's guilt. He admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to kill, but only the guilty. Finding himself terminally ill, he devises and carries out this plot. Isaac Morris is an unethical lawyer hired by Wargrave to purchase the island (under the name UN Owen), arrange the gramophone recording, and make arrangements on his behalf, including gathering information on the near destitute Philip Lombard, to whom he gave some money to get by and recommended Lombard bring his gun to the island. Morris's is the first death, as he died before the guests arrived on the island. Morris was responsible for the addiction and suicide of a young woman through his narcotics activities. The victim was the daughter of a friend of Wargrave. He accepts Wargrave's lethal cocktail of pills, as something that would help him. Fred Narracott, the boatman who delivered the guests to the island. After doing so, he does not appear again in the story, although Inspector Maine notes it was Narracott who, sensing something seriously amiss, returned to the island as soon as the weather allowed, before he was scheduled to do, and found the bodies. Maine speculates that it was the normalcy and ordinariness of the guests that convinced Narracott to do so and ignore his orders to dismiss any signals requesting help. Sir Thomas Legge and Inspector Maine, two Scotland Yard detectives who discuss the case in the epilogue. They reason out the events of the case, but are stymied as to which was the murderer until the confession comes to light. Literary significance and reception (edit) Writing for The Times Literary Supplement of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, ``If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders... There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer'', he continued. ``It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.'' For The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where ``the voice'' accuses the ten ``guests'' of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, ``When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.'' Many compared the book to her novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926). For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, ``Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With And Then There Were None... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the Roger Ackroyd level.'' Other critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observer's issue of 5 November 1939 which began, ``No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.'' After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, ``Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.'' Robert Barnard, a recent critic, concurred with the reviews, describing the book as ``Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.'' The original title of the mystery (Ten Little Niggers) has been changed because it was offensive in English-speaking countries and some others. Few critics have opined that Christie's original title and the setting on ``Nigger Island'' (later changed to ``Indian Island'' and ``Soldier Island'', variously) may be integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, argues Alison Light, ``could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness ', a place where revelations about the 'dark side 'of the English would be appropriate.'' Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, ``Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.'' In the ``Binge!'' article of Entertainment Weekly Issue# 1343-44 (26 December 2014--3 January 2015), the writers picked And Then There Were None as an ``EW favorite'' on the list of the ``Nine Great Christie Novels''. Current published version of the rhyme (edit) Main article: Ten Little Injuns Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little Soldier Boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.

One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none. 19th-century original verses (edit) This children's rhyme was originally written as songs in the 19th century, one in Britain in 1869 and one in the US in 1868. 1869& 1868 verses Ten Little Niggers (Frank Green) Ten Little Indians (Septimus Winner) Ten little nigger boys went out to dine One choked his little self, and then there were nine.

The title (edit) Cover of first US 1940 edition with current title for all English-language versions. The novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the UK it appeared under the title Ten Little Niggers, in book and newspaper serialized formats. The serialization was in 23 parts in the Daily Express from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by ``Prescott'' with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions. The book retailed for seven shillings and six pence. In the United States it was published under the title And Then There Were None, again in both book and serial formats. Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to contemporary UK culture, rather than a fairly innocent rhyme for children to use when selecting one child for a game. The serialized version appeared in the Saturday Evening Post in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for$2. In the original UK novel all references to ``Indians'' or ``Soldiers'' were originally ``Nigger'', including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines. (In Chapter 7, Vera Claythorne becomessemi-hysterical at the mention by Miss Brent of ``our black brothers'', which is understandable only in the context of the original name.) UK editions changed to the current definitive title in 1985. The word ``nigger'' was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition and first serialization changed the title to And Then There Were None and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture. Publication history (edit) This is the best selling crime novel of all time, and what makes Agatha Christie the best selling novelist. It is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time. Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title. The book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including Ten Little Indians (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), Ten Little Soldiers and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, And Then There Were None. UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title And Then There Were None appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.

Christie, Agatha (1986). Ten Little Indians. New York: Pocket Books. ISBN 0-671-55222-8. (Last publication of novel under the title Ten Little Indians.) Foreign language editions The sensitivity of the original British title varies across nations, depending on their culture and which words are used to describe people by skin color. In the US, the British title was considered offensive at first publication, and changed to the last line of the rhyme instead of its title. As the estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under one title only in English, And Then There Were None, it is likely that new foreign language editions will match that title in their language. The original title (Ten Little Niggers) still survives in a few foreign-language versions of the novel, such as the Bulgarian title \u0414\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u044a\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430, and was used in other languages for a time, for example in Dutch until the 1994 release of the 18th edition. The title Ten Little Negroes continues to be commonly used in foreign-language versions, for example in Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Romanian, French and Hungarian, as well as a 1987 Russian film adaptation \u0414\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044f\u0442 (Desyat Negrityat). In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre staged the play under its original title but changed to A napokon nezostal u\u017e nik (And Then There Were None)mid-run. Possible inspirations (edit) The 1930 novel The Invisible Host by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death. The Invisible Host was adapted as the 1930 Broadway The Ninth Guest by Owen Davis, which itself was adapted as the 1934 film The Ninth Guest. The 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film A Study in Scarlet follows a strikingly similar plot; it includes a scene where Holmes is shown a card with the hint: ``Six little Indians... bee stung one and then there were five''. In this case, the rhyme refers to ``Ten Little Fat Boys''. (The film's plot bears no resemblance to Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name.) The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, ``doubted that (Christie) had seen A Study in Scarlet, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her''. Adaptations (edit) And Then There Were None has had more adaptations than any other single work by Agatha Christie. It is the isolated location where all the players on scene are murdered, never knowing who their murderer is, that is the idea. ``It was an idea which is now the basis for many Hollywood horror films and has become a clich\u00e9 to modern audiences, but it was Agatha Christie who was the first to do it and so successfully that the story has become her most adapted piece.'' She changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943. Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island. With a plot line so well known, parodies and references to the novel or the play are frequent. Many television programs use the essence of the plot, a group of characters cut off from the outside world with a murderer in their midst, but with innocent victims in place of guilty victims, and give no credit to Agatha Christie for the many differences in plot and motivation. Film (edit) There have been numerous film adaptations of the novel, some comedic. Examples include: And Then There Were None (1945 film), Ren\u00e9 Clair's cinema adaptation, was a successful US production Ten Little Indians (1965 film), is George Pollock's cinema adaptation Gumnaam (1965, translation: Unknown or Anonymous) is an Indian suspense thriller film adaptation. Five Dolls for an August Moon (1970) is a loose Italian giallo adaptation directed by Mario Bava. Nadu Iravil (1970, translation: In the middle of the night), a Tamil adaptation directed by Sundaram Balachander And Then There Were None (1974 film), the first English-language colour version, directed by Peter Collinson Desyat 'Negrityat (1987, \u0414\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044f\u0442, Eng: ``Ten Little Negroes'') Stanislav Govorukhin's Russian adaptation keeps intact Christie's grim storyline and ending. Ten Little Indians, a 1989 American version directed by Alan Birkinshaw Aduthathu (2012) is a Tamil adaptation Aatagara (2015) is a Kannada film adaptation Radio (edit) The BBC broadcast ``Ten Little Niggers'' (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as Saturday Night Theatre on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December. On 13 November 2010, as part of its Saturday Play series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson. The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured, among others, Geoffrey Whitehead as Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr. Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent. In this production, which is extremely faithful to the novel, the rhyme is ``Ten Little Soldier Boys''. Stage (edit) And Then There Were None (1943 play) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story. Thus, she reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General Macarthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions. By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name. Regardless of the reason, it was changed. Ten little niggers (1944 play), Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel. The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Agatha Christie credited as the dramatist. It was the first performance in repertory theatre. It was staged again in 1965. There was an article in the Dundee Evening Register in August 1944 And Then There Were None (2005 play), On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original. Television (edit) Several variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of which were British adaptations. The first of these, in 1949, was produced by the BBC. The second was produced in 1959, by ITV. Both of those productions aired with Christie's original title. The third and most recent British adaptation aired as And Then There Were None on BBC One in December 2015, as amini-series produced in cooperation with Acorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions. The 2015 production adhered more closely to the original plot, though there were several differences, and was the first English language film adaptation to feature an ending similar to that of the novel. On 25 and 26 March 2017 TV Asahi in Japan aired \u305d\u3057\u3066 \u8ab0 \u3082\u3044 \u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063 \u305f (Soshite daremo inakunatta), a Japanese language adaptation by Nagasaka Shukei (\u9577\u5742 \u79c0\u4f73) of the original story set in modern times. Other Media (edit) The novel has been the inspiration for several video games. For the Apple II, Online Systems released the game Mystery House in 1980. On the PC, The Adventure Company released the video game Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels. In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console. The identity of the murderer is not that of the killer in the original book. The game player assumes the role of Patrick Naracott (brother of Fred Naracott, who is involved in a newly created subplot), who is stranded with the others when his boat is scuttled. This allows for alternate, more successful endings in which Naracott survives and is able to prevent the murders of the innocent Lombard and Claythorne. All endings depart markedly from the novel and previous adaptations in that the killer and motives are different. And Then There Were None was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by Fran\u00e7ois Rivi\u00e8re and illustrated by Frank Leclercq. Pek\u00e1 Editorial released a board game based on the book, created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarr\u00eda, and illustrated by Esperanza Peinado.

Colt is frequently the butt of jokes from his father and brother, particularly when it comes to his ranching skills (or lack thereof) and his disappointing pro football career. He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense, but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue throughout the first season, it's implied that Colt has played for the Barcelona Dragons, San Jose SaberCats, Spokane Shock, Orlando Predators, Nebraska Danger, Minnesota Axemen and Philadelphia Soul. Dialogue also states that he was a member of teams in Canada, notably the fictional Saskatoon Cold (``Like the Miami Heat... only cold'') and Alaska. He also states in the first episode he was the back up of the back up of the back up for Florida State and won the championship in 1999. Danny Masterson as Jameson ``Rooster'' Bennett, Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career. Despite living in Colt's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker. He has however been just as irresponsible as Colt, drinking too much and sleeping around. Debra Winger as Margaret ``Maggie'' Bennett, owner of Maggie's, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns.

Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker. Elisha Cuthbert as Abigail ``Abby'' Phillips, a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school and current girlfriend.

(recurring, season 1; main cast, season 2) Sam Elliott as Beau Bennett, Maggie'sex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died.

The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development. Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this architecture has become popular for designing web applications and even mobile, desktop and other clients. Popular programming languages like Java,C#, Ruby, PHP have MVC frameworks that are used in web application development straight out of the box.

Particular MVC architectures can vary significantly from the traditional description here. Components (edit) The model is the central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The third part or section, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view. Interactions (edit) In addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the model--view--controller design defines the interactions between them. The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller. The view means presentation of the model in a particular format. The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model. History (edit) One of the seminal insights in the early development of graphical user interfaces, MVC became one of the first approaches to describe and implement software constructs in terms of their responsibilities. Trygve Reenskaug introduced MVC into Smalltalk-76 while visiting the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of MVC for the Smalltalk-80 class library. Only later did a 1988 article in The Journal of Object Technology (JOT) express MVC as a general concept. The MVC pattern has subsequently evolved, giving rise to variants such as hierarchical model--view--controller (HMVC), model--view--adapter (MVA), model--view--presenter (MVP), model--view--viewmodel (MVVM), and others that adapted MVC to different contexts. The use of the MVC pattern in web applications exploded in popularity after the introduction of NeXT's WebObjects in 1996, which was originally written in Objective-C (that borrowed heavily from Smalltalk) and helped enforce MVC principles. Later, the MVC pattern became popular with Java developers when WebObjects was ported to Java. Later frameworks for Java, such as Spring (released in October 2002), continued the strong bond between Java and MVC. The introduction of the frameworks Django (July 2005, for Python) and Rails (December 2005, for Ruby), both of which had a strong emphasis on rapid deployment, increased MVC's popularity outside the traditional enterprise environment in which it has long been popular. MVC web frameworks now hold large market-shares relative tonon-MVC web toolkits. Use in web applications (edit) Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as an architecture for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server. Some web MVC frameworks take a thin client approach that places almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. This is reflected in frameworks such as Django, Rails and ASP.NET MVC. In this approach, the client sends either hyperlink requests or form submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server. Other frameworks such as AngularJS, EmberJS, JavaScriptMVC and Backbone allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client (also see Ajax). Goals of MVC (edit) This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Simultaneous development (edit) Because MVC decouples the various components of an application, developers are able to work in parallel on different components without impacting or blocking one another. For example, a team might divide their developers between the front-end and the back-end. The back-end developers can design the structure of the data and how the user interacts with it without requiring the user interface to be completed. Conversely, the front-end developers are able to design and test the layout of the application prior to the data structure being available. Code reuse (edit) By creating components that are independent of each other, developers are able to reuse components quickly and easily in other applications. The same (or similar) view for one application can be refactored for another application with different data because the view is simply handling how the data is being displayed to the user. Advantages& disadvantages (edit) Advantages (edit) Simultaneous development--Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views. High cohesion--MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together. Low coupling--The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views or controllers Ease of modification--Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier Multiple views for a model--Models can have multiple views Disadvantages (edit) Code navigability--The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of abstraction and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.Multi-artifact consistency--Decomposing a feature into three artifacts causes scattering. Thus, requiring developers to maintain the consistency of multiple representations at once. Pronounced learning curve--Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies.

The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following a series of clashes along the border. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union also gave some assistance to the North. Korea was ruled by Imperial Japan from 1910 until the closing days of World War II. In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Imperial Japan, as a result of an agreement with the United States, and liberated Korea north of the 38th parallel. U.S. forces subsequently moved into the south. By 1948, as a product of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments. Both claimed to be the legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces--supported by the Soviet Union and China--moved into the south on 25 June 1950. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation and dispatch of UN forces to Korea to repel what was recognized as a North Korean invasion. Twenty-one countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel. After the first two months of war, South Korean and U.S. forces rapidly dispatched to Korea were on the point of defeat, forced back to a small area in the south known as the Pusan Perimeter. In September 1950, an amphibious UNcounter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many North Korean troops. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north. UN forces rapidly approached the Yalu River--the border with China--but in October 1950, mass Chinese forces crossed the Yalu and entered the war. The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces which continued untilmid-1951. After these reversals of fortune, which saw Seoul change hands four times, the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th parallel. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate. North Korea was subject to a massive bombing campaign. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty has been signed, and according to some sources the two Koreas are technically still at war. As a war undeclared by all participants, the conflict helped bring the term ``police action'' into common use. It also led to the permanent alteration of the balance of power within the United Nations, where Resolution 377--passed in 1950 to allow a bypassing of the Security Council if that body could not reach an agreement--led to the General Assembly displacing the Security Council as the primary organ of the UN.

Truman as a ``police action'' as it was an undeclared military action, conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. It has been referred to in the English-speaking world as ``The Forgotten War'' or ``The Unknown War'' because of the lack of public attention it received both during and after the war, and in relation to the global scale of World War II, which preceded it, and the subsequent angst of the Vietnam War, which succeeded it. In South Korea, the war is usually referred to as ``625'' or the ``6--2--5 Upheaval'' (6.25 \ub3d9\ub780 (\u52d5\u4e82), yook-i-o dongnan), reflecting the date of its commencement on 25 June. In North Korea, the war is officially referred to as the ``Fatherland Liberation War'' (Choguk haebang ch\u01d2njaeng) or alternatively the ``Chos\u01d2n (Korean) War'' (\uc870\uc120 \uc804\uc7c1, Chos\u01d2n ch\u01d2njaeng). In China, the war is officially called the ``War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea'' (simplified Chinese: \u6297\u7f8e\u63f4\u671d \u6218\u4e89; traditional Chinese: \u6297\u7f8e\u63f4\u671d \u6230\u722d; pinyin: K\u00e0ngm\u011biyu\u00e1nch\u00e1o zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng), although the term ``Chaoxian (Korean) War'' (simplified Chinese: \u671d\u9c9c \u6218\u4e89; traditional Chinese: \u671d\u9bae \u6230\u722d; pinyin: Ch\u00e1oxi\u01cen zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng) is also used in unofficial contexts, along with the term ``Han (Korean) War'' (simplified Chinese: \u97e9 \u6218; traditional Chinese: \u97d3 \u6230; pinyin: H\u00e1n Zh\u00e0n) more commonly used in regions such as Hong Kong and Macau. Background Imperial Japanese rule (1910--1945) Main article: Korea under Japanese rule Imperial Japan destroyed the influence of China over Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894--95), ushering in the short-lived Korean Empire. A decade later, after defeating Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904--05), Japan made Korea its protectorate with the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, then annexed it with the Japan--Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910. Many Korean nationalists fled the country. A Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 in Nationalist China. It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its U.S.-based founding President, Syngman Rhee. From 1919 to 1925 and beyond, Korean communists led internal and external warfare against the Japanese. In China, the Nationalist National Revolutionary Army and the communist People's Liberation Army helped organize Korean refugees against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the Burma Campaign (December 1941--August 1945). The communists, led by Kim Il-sung among others, fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria. At the Cairo Conference in November 1943, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States all decided that ``in due course Korea shall become free and independent''. Soviet--Japanese War (1945) Main article: Soviet--Japanese War (1945) At the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War within three months of the victory in Europe. Accordingly, it declared war on Japan on 9 August 1945, three days after the USA dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. By 10 August, the Red Army had begun to occupy the northern part of the Korean peninsula. On the night of 10 August in Washington, U.S. colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were tasked with dividing the Korean Peninsula into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel. This was incorporated into the U.S. General Order No. 1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, ``even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops''. He noted that he was ``faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area''. As Rusk's comments indicate, the U.S. doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this. Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy ofco-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south. Korea divided (1945--1949) See also: Division of Korea On 8 September 1945, U.S. Lt. Gen. John R. Hodge arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel. Appointed as military governor, General Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945--48). He attempted to establish control by restoring Japanese colonial administrators to power, but in the face of Korean protests he quickly reversed this decision. The USAMGIK refused to recognize the provisional government of the short-lived People's Republic of Korea (PRK) due to its suspected Communist sympathies. In December 1945, Korea was administered by a U.S.-Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, with the aim of granting independence after a five-year trusteeship. The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out. To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945. The right-wing Representative Democratic Council, led by Syngman Rhee, who had arrived with the U.S. military, opposed the trusteeship, arguing that Korea had already suffered from foreign occupation far too long. Following further large-scale civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law. Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the U.S. government decided to hold an election under United Nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent Korea. The Soviet authorities and the Korean Communists refused toco-operate on the grounds it would not be fair, and many South Korean politicians boycotted it. A general election was held in the South on 10 May 1948. North Korea held parliamentary elections three months later on 25 August. The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948, and elected Syngman Rhee as President on 20 July 1948. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948. In the Soviet Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviet Union established a communist government led by Kim Il-sung. The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948, and U.S. troops withdrew in 1949. Chinese Civil War (1945--1949) Main article: Chinese Civil War With the end of the war with Japan, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Communists and Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with mat\u00e9riel and manpower. According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) during the war. North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge fornon-combatants and communications with the rest of China. The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between50,000 and70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea. China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea. The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-sung's authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il-yu, who was later purged by Kim. After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security. Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States 'crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery. Prelude to War (1950) By 1949, South Korean forces had reduced the active number of communist guerrillas in the South from5,000 to1,000. However, Kim Il-sung believed that the guerrillas weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population. Kim began seeking Stalin's support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to attempt to persuade him. Serious border clashes between South and North occurred on August 4, 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th parallel. The 2nd and 18th infantry regiments of ROKA repulsed initial attacks in Kuksa-bong (above the 38th parallel) andCh'ungmu, and at the end of the clashes ROKA troops were ``completely routed''. Stalin initially did not think the time was right for a war in Korea. Chinese Communist forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while U.S. forces remained stationed in South Korea. By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: Mao's Communist forces had secured final victory in China, U.S. forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the U.S. atomic monopoly. As the U.S. had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the U.S. to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States. Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned the U.S. would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border. Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated. Soviet generals with extensive combat experience from the Second World War were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group. These generals completed the plans for the attack by May. The original plans called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea. The North Koreans would then launch a counterattack that would capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the South Korean army. The final stage would involve destroying South Korean government remnants, capturing the rest of South Korea, including the ports. On 7 June 1950, Kim Il-sung called for a Korea-wide election on 5--8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15--17 June 1950. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture that Rhee rejected outright. On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin peninsula. Kim was concerned that South Korean agents learned about the plans and South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses. Stalin agreed to this change of plan. While these preparations were underway in the North, there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, many initiated by the South. The Republic of Korea Army (ROK Army) was being trained by the U.S. Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG). On the eve of war, KMAG's commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide ``target practice''. For his part, Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North, including when U.S. diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June. Although some South Korean and U.S. intelligence officers predicted an attack from the North, similar predictions were made before and nothing happened. The Central Intelligence Agency noted the southward movement by the Korean People's Army (KPA), but assessed this as a ``defensive measure'' and concluded an invasion was ``unlikely''. On 23 June, UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent. Comparison of forces Throughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) were released to North Korea. The combat veterans from China, the tanks, artillery and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea's military superiority over the South, armed by the US military with mostly small arms and given no heavy weaponry such as tanks. According to the first official census in 1949 the population of North Korea numbered9,620,000, and bymid-1950 North Korean forces numbered between150,000 and200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea. Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their armies. In contrast, the Republic of Korea population totaled20,188,641, and its army was unprepared and ill-equipped. As of 25 June 1950 the ROK Army had98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat,33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT6 advanced-trainer airplanes. Large U.S. garrisons and air forces were in Japan, but only 200-300 American troops were in Korea. Course of the War Territory often changed hands early in the war, until the front stabilized. North Korean and Chinese forces South Korean, U.S., Commonwealth, and United Nations forces Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans fled south inmid-1950 after the North Korean army invaded At dawn on Sunday, 25 June 1950, the Korean People's Army crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire. The KPA justified its assault with the claim that ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the ``bandit traitor Syngman Rhee''. Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin peninsula in the west. There were initial South Korean claims that they captured the city of Haeju, and this sequence of events has led some scholars to argue that the South Koreans fired first. Whoever fired the first shots in Ongjin, within an hour, North Korean forces attacked all along the 38th parallel. The North Koreans had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery. The South Koreans had no tanks,anti-tank weapons or heavy artillery, to stop such an attack. In addition, South Koreans committed their forces in a piecemeal fashion and these were routed in a few days. On 27 June, Rhee evacuated from Seoul with some of the government. On 28 June, at 2 am, the South Korean Army blew up the highway Hangang Bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the North Korean army. The bridge was detonated while4,000 refugees were crossing it and hundreds were killed. Destroying the bridge also trapped many South Korean military units north of the Han River. In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day. A number of South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell, and forty-eight subsequently pledged allegiance to the North. On 28 June, Rhee ordered the massacre of suspected political opponents in his own country. In five days, the South Korean forces, which had95,000 men on 25 June, was down to less than22,000 men. In early July, when U.S. forces arrived, what was left of the South Korean forces were placed under U.S. operational command of the United Nations Command. Factors in U.S. intervention The Truman administration was unprepared for the invasion. Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Truman himself was at his home in Independence, Missouri. Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved. One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, U.S. experts on East Asia saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea. Said Kim: ``The recognition that the security of Japan required anon-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene... The essential point... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of U.S. policy toward Japan.'' Another major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the U.S. intervened. The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea. At the same time, ``(t) here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from (the conflict)''. Yugoslavia--a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin Split--was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council'spost-North Korea invasion list of ``chief danger spots''. Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the United Nations and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere. The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the U.S. immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end. The Truman administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone. The Truman administration was still uncertain if the attack was a ploy by the Soviet Union or just a test of U.S. resolve. The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqu\u00e9 was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against U.S. forces in Korea. The Truman administration now believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere. United Nations Security Council resolutions Further information: List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea On 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with UN Security Council Resolution 82. The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese ``Republic of China'' and not the mainland ``People's Republic of China'' held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June President Truman ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean regime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the United States of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea. The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north-south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of all the six permanent members including the Soviet Union. Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers--of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee regime--were retreating southwards or defecting en masse to the northern side, the KPA. United Nations 'response (July--August 1950) A U.S. howitzer position near the Kum River, 15 July As soon as word of the attack was received, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed President Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the U.S. goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975): Communism was acting in Korea, just as Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese had ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors. In August 1950, the President and the Secretary of State obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate$12 billion for military action in Korea. Because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced withre-organizing and deploying a U.S. military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart. Acting on State Secretary Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer mat\u00e9riel to the South Korean military while giving air cover to the evacuation of U.S. nationals. The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea. The United States denied ROC's request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation. Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to ``neutralize'' the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as ``armed aggression on Chinese territory''. The drive South and Pusan (July--September 1950) G.I. comforting a grieving infantryman Crew of an M-24 tank along the Nakdong River front, August 1950 The Battle of Osan, the first significant U.S. engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division which had been flown in from Japan. On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans 'tanks. They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the U.S. force at Pyongtaek, Chonan, and Chochiwon, forcing the 24th Division's retreat to Taejeon, which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon; the 24th Division suffered3,602 dead and wounded and2,962 captured, including the Division's Commander, Major General William F. Dean. By August, the KPA steadily pushed back the ROK Army and the Eighth United States Army southwards. The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as U.S. troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions. Lacking sufficientanti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, they were driven down the Korean peninsula. During their advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities. By September, UN forces were hemmed into a small corner of southeast Korea, near Pusan. This 140-mile perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River. Although Kim's early successes led him to predict he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a possible U.S. deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea. Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for U.S. naval activity in the Korea Strait. In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter (August--September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge,P'ohang-dong, and Taegu. The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night. To deny mat\u00e9riel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs. Consequently, theover-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south. On 27 August, 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident. The U.S. proposed that a commission of India and Sweden determine what the U.S. should pay in compensation but the Soviets vetoed the U.S. proposal. Meanwhile, U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and mat\u00e9riel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter. Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the U.S. mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready. In early September 1950, ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA180,000 to100,000 soldiers. Battle of Inchon (September 1950) Main article: Battle of Inchon General Douglas MacArthur, UN Command CiC (seated), observes the naval shelling of Incheon from USS Mount McKinley, 15 September 1950 Combat in the streets of Seoul Against the rested andre-armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN Command, they lacked naval and air support. To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Incheon, near Seoul and well over 160 km (100 mi) behind the KPA lines. On 6 July, he ordered Major General Hobart R. Gay, Commander, 1st Cavalry Division, to plan the division's amphibious landing at Incheon; on 12--14 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from Yokohama, Japan, to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter. Soon after the war began, General MacArthur began planning a landing at Incheon, but the Pentagon opposed him. When authorized, he activated a combined U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and ROK Army force. The X Corps, led by General Edward Almond, Commander, consisted of40,000 men of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around8,600 ROK Army soldiers. By 15 September, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon. After the Incheon landing, the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter. ``Task Force Lynch'' (after Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch), 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and two 70th Tank Battalion units (Charlie Company and the Intelligence--Reconnaissance Platoon) effected the ``Pusan Perimeter Breakout'' through 171.2 km (106.4 mi) of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan. The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea. On 18 September, Stalin dispatched General H.M. Zakharov to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul. Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans. As the overall commander of Chinese forces, Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Incheon only if they had reserves of at least100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north. On 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces. U.S. air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable. During the general retreat only25,000 to30,000 North Korean soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines. On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat. UN forces cross partition line (September--October 1950) Main article: UN Offensive, 1950 On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/ 1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if ``at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily''. On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee. On 30 September, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: ``We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel.'' During October, the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951. U.S. Air Force attacking railroads south of Wonsan on the eastern coast of North Korea On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively. Historian Bruce Cumings argues, however, the KPA's rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts. By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea. MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender. Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards. The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces. The Eighth U.S. Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang city, the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon. The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue U.S. prisoners of war. At month's end, UN forces held135,000 KPA prisoners of war. As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50--100 miles of mountainous terrain. Taking advantage of the UN Command's strategic momentum against the communists, General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort. President Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border. China intervenes (October--December 1950) Chinese forces cross the Yalu River On 20 August 1950, Premier Zhou Enlai informed the UN that ``Korea is China's neighbor... The Chinese people can not but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question''. Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese national security, they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea. President Truman interpreted the communication as ``a bald attempt to blackmail the UN'', and dismissed it. Three commanders of PVA during the Korean War. From left to right: Chen Geng (1952), Peng Dehuai (1950--1952) and Deng Hua (1952--1953) On 1 October 1950, the day that UN troops crossed the 38th parallel, the Soviet ambassador forwarded a telegram from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea, and Kim Il-sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene. In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2 to 5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea. There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the U.S. in Korea. Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him. After Lin Biao politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment), Mao decided that Peng Dehuai would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position. Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders. After Peng made the case that if U.S. troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea. On 4 August 1950, with a planned invasion of Taiwan aborted due to the heavy U.S. naval presence, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. On 8 October 1950, Mao Zedong redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA). To enlist Stalin's support, Zhou and a Chinese delegation arrived in Moscow on 10 October, at which point they flew to Stalin's home at the Black Sea. There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951. Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu. Soviet shipments of mat\u00e9riel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like. Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered two hundred thousand Chinese troops to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October. UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection. The PVA marched ``dark-to-dark'' (19: 00--03: 00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05: 30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 460 km (286 mi) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 29 km (18 mi) daily for 18 days. A Soviet-built MiG 15 in North Korean markings. The arrival of MiGs challenged UN air superiority Meanwhile, on 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at Wake Island in themid-Pacific Ocean. This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental United States. To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had some300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some100,000--125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River. He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, ``if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter'' without air force protection. After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union. Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China. After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults--from the north, northwest, and west--and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan. The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to theCh'ongch'on River, while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory. It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory. Soldiers from the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division in action near theCh'ongch'on River, 20 November 1950 The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese openly intervened because of the sudden Chinese withdrawal. On 24 November, the Home-by-Christmas Offensive was launched with the U.S. Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while the US X Corps attacked along the Korean east coast. But the Chinese were waiting in ambush with their Second Phase Offensive. After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou Enlai the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander. On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of theCh'ongch'on River, and then inflicted heavy losses on the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces 'right flank. The UN Command retreated; the U.S. Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history) was made possible because of the Turkish Brigade's successful, but very costly, rear-guard delaying action near Kunuri that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27--29 November). On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,000--15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but escaped under Air Force and X Corps support fire--albeit with some15,000 collective casualties. F4U-5 Corsairs provide close air support to U.S. Marines fighting Chinese forces, December 1950. By 30 November, the PVA 13th Army Group managed to expel the U.S. Eighth Army from northwest Korea. Retreating from the north faster than they hadcounter-invaded, the Eighth Army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid December. UN morale hit rock bottom when commanding General Walton Walker of the U.S. Eighth Army was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident. In northeast Korea by 11 December, the U.S. X Corps managed to cripple the PVA 9th Army Group while establishing a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam. The X Corps were forced to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted U.S. Eighth Army to the south. Map of the UN retreat in the wake of Chinese intervention During the Hungnam evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN Command forces and mat\u00e9riel (approximately105,000 soldiers,98,000 civilians,17,500 vehicles, and350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan. The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers. Before escaping, the UN Command forces razed most of Hungnam city, especially the port facilities; and on 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national emergency with Presidential Proclamation No. 2914, 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953), which remained in force until 14 September 1978. The next day (17 December 1950) Kim Il-sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China. After that, the leading part of the war became the Chinese army. China justified its entry into the war as a response to ``American aggression in the guise of the UN''. Later, the Chinese claimed that U.S. bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened. Fighting around the 38th parallel (January--June 1951) With Lieutenant-General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive (also known as the ``Chinese New Year's Offensive'') on New Year's Eve of 1950. Utilizing night attacks in which UN Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy. UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south. The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to conquer Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951. B-26 Invaders bomb logistics depots in Wonsan, North Korea, 1951 These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains. However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the esprit de corps of the bloodied Eighth Army immediately began to revive. UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held. The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and mat\u00e9riel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines. In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Roundup (5 February 1951). A full-scale X Corps advance proceeded, which fully exploited the UN Command's air superiority, concluding with the UN reaching the Han River and recapturing Wonju. Following the failure of ceasefire negotiations in January, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 498 on 1 February, condemning PRC as an aggressor, and called upon its forces to withdraw from Korea. In early February, the South Korean 11th Division ran the operation to destroy the guerrillas and their sympathizer citizens in Southern Korea. During the operation, the division and police conducted the Geochang massacre and Sancheong-Hamyang massacre. Inmid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong. But the offensive was soon blunted by the IX Corps positions at Chipyong-ni in the center. The U.S. 2nd Infantry ``Warrior'' Division's 23rd Regimental Combat Team and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum. The battle is sometimes known as the ``Gettysburg of the Korean War''.5,600 South Korean, U.S., and French troops were surrounded on all sides by25,000 Chinese. United Nations forces had previously retreated in the face of large Communist forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought, and won. U.S. Marines move out over rugged mountain terrain while closing with North Korean forces In the last two weeks of February 1951, Operation Roundup was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible. Operation Killer concluded with I Corpsre-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong. On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951. This was the city's fourth conquest in a year's time, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5 millionpre-war population was down to200,000, and people were suffering from severe food shortages. On 1 March 1951, Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin agreed to supply two air force divisions, threeanti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these efforts were never sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the Chinese Air Force began participating in the war from September 1951 onward. On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea. There were several reasons for the dismissal. MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo. MacArthur was relieved primarily from his determination to expand the war into China, which other officials believed would needlessly escalate a limited war and consume too many already overstretched resources. Despite MacArthur's claims that he was restricted to fighting a limited war when China was fighting all-out, congressional testimony revealed China was using restraint as much as the U.S. was, as they were not using air power against front-line troops, communication lines, ports, naval air forces, or staging bases in Japan, which had been crucial to the survival of UN forces in Korea. Simply fighting on the peninsula had already tied down significant portions of U.S. airpower; as Air Force chief of staff Hoyt Vandenberg said, 80--85% the tactical capacity, one-fourth of the strategic portion, and 20% of air defense forces of the United States were engaged in a single country. There was also fear that crossing into China would provoke the Soviet Union into entering the war; General Omar Bradley testified that there were 35 Russian divisions totaling some500,000 troops in the Far East, which if sent into action with the approximately 85 Russian submarines in the vicinity of Korea, they could overwhelm U.S. forces and cut supply lines, as well as potentially assist China in taking over territory in Southeast Asia. British UN troops advance alongside a Centurion tank, March 1951 General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander, Korea; he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks, while General James Van Fleet assumed command of the U.S. Eighth Army. Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23--28 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March 1951) were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to ``Line Kansas'', north of the 38th parallel. The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team's (``Rakkasans'') second of two combat jumps was on Easter Sunday, 1951, at Munsan-ni, South Korea, codenamed Operation Tomahawk. The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their movement north. The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission. The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, also known as the Chinese Spring Offensive, with three field armies (approximately700,000 men). The offensive's first thrust fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22--25 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (22--25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the ``No-name Line'' north of Seoul. On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May. At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained ``Line Kansas'', just north of the 38th parallel. The UN's ``Line Kansas'' halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953. Stalemate (July 1951--July 1953) U.S. M46 Patton tanks, painted with tiger heads thought to demoralize Chinese forces ROK soldiers dump spent artillery casings New Zealand artillery crew in action, 1952 For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held. Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong. On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces 'goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory. The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war. The principal battles of the stalemate include the Battle of Bloody Ridge (18 August--15 September 1951), the Battle of the Punchbowl (31 August-21 September 1951), the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge (13 September--15 October 1951), the Battle of Old Baldy (26 June--4 August 1952), the Battle of White Horse (6--15 October 1952), the Battle of Triangle Hill (14 October--25 November 1952), the Battle of Hill Eerie (21 March--21 June 1952), the sieges of Outpost Harry (10--18 June 1953), the Battle of the Hook (28--29 May 1953), the Battle of Pork Chop Hill (23 March--16 July 1953), and the Battle of Kumsong (13--27 July 1953). Chinese troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers. All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that, on November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems. At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible. These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops. In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future. On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: ``You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?'' The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide moreanti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Armistice (July 1953--November 1954) Men from the Royal Australian Regiment, June 1953. The on-again, off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years, first at Kaesong, on the border between North and South Korea, and then at the neighboring village of Panmunjom. A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation. The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans. In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, under the chairman Indian General K.S. Thimayya, was set up to handle the matter. In 1952, the United States elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War. With the United Nations 'acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel. Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands. The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west. The old Korean capital city of Kaesong, site of the armistice negotiations, originally was inpre-war South Korea, but now is part of North Korea. The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting. The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty. North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War. After the war, Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead. The remains of4,167 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps dead were exchanged for13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government. After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (The Punchbowl), on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Defense Prisoner of War/ Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted1,394 names, of which 858 were correct. From4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified4,219 individuals. Of these,2,944 were identified as from the U.S., and all but 416 were identified by name. From 1996 to 2006, the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.

Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish Armed Forces, has been stationed near the DMZ. In April 1975, South Vietnam's capital was captured by the North Vietnamese army. Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to invade the South. Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to ask for military aid. Despite Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea. A U.S. Army officer confers with South Korean soldiers at Observation Post (OP) Ouellette, viewing northward, in April 2008. The DMZ as seen from the north, 2005. Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea. In 1976, the axe murder incident was widely publicized. Since 1974, four incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette ROKS Cheonan, resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors. Again in 2010, North Korea fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong island, killing two military personnel and two civilians. After a new wave of UN sanctions, on 11 March 2013, North Korea claimed that it invalidated the 1953 armistice. On 13 March 2013, North Korea confirmed it ended the 1953 Armistice and declared North Korea ``is not restrained by the North-South declaration onnon-aggression''. On 30 March 2013, North Korea stated that it entered a ``state of war'' with South Korea and declared that ``The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over''. Speaking on 4 April 2013, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, informed the press that Pyongyang ``formally informed'' the Pentagon that it ``ratified'' the potential use of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the United States of America, including Guam and Hawaii. Hagel also stated the United States would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defenseanti-ballistic missile system to Guam, because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat from North Korea. In 2016, it was revealed that North Korea approached the United States about conducting formal peace talks to formally end the war. While the White House agreed to secret peace talks, the plan was rejected due to North Korea's refusal to discuss nuclear disarmament as part of the terms of the treaty. Any possibility of talks ended on 6 January when North Korea conducted their fourth nuclear test. Characteristics Korean War memorials are found in every UN Command Korean War participant country; this one is in Pretoria, South Africa. Casualties According to the data from the U.S. Department of Defense, the United States suffered33,686 battle deaths, along with2,830non-battle deaths, during the Korean War. U.S. battle deaths were8,516 up to their first engagement with the Chinese on 1 November 1950. South Korea reported some373,599 civilian and137,899 military deaths. Western sources estimate the PVA suffered about400,000 killed and486,000 wounded, while the KPA suffered215,000 killed and303,000 wounded. Data from official Chinese sources, on the other hand, reported that the Chinese PVA had suffered114,000 battle deaths,34,000non-battle deaths,340,000 wounded,7,600 missing and during the war.7,110 Chinese POWs were repatriated to China. Chinese sources also reported that North Korea had suffered290,000 casualties,90,000 captured and a large number of civilian deaths. CNN reported, citing Enciclopedia Britannica that North Korean civilian casualties were600,000, while South Korean civilian casualties reached one million. The Chinese and North Koreans estimated that about390,000 soldiers from the United States,660,000 soldiers from South Korea and29,000 other UN soldiers were ``eliminated'' from the battlefield. Recent scholarship puts the full battle death toll on all sides at just over 1.2 million. U.S. unpreparedness for War In a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of U.S. Army forces deployed to Korea during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated that ``Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man... (T) hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.'' By 1950, U.S. Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson had established a policy of faithfully following President Truman's defense economization plans, and had aggressively attempted to implement it even in the face of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained U.S. military forces in the war's early stages. As an initial response to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea, and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only ``on paper'', since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request. Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea. Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion. Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service. A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls. A Navy helicopter pilot aboard an active duty warship recalled fixing damaged rotor blades with masking tape in the absence of spares. Army Reserve and Army National Guard infantry soldiers and new inductees called to duty to fill out understrength infantry divisions found themselves short of nearly everything needed to repel the North Korean forces: artillery, ammunition, heavy tanks, ground-support aircraft, even effectiveanti-tank weapons such as the M20 3.5-inch (89 mm) Super Bazooka. Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn out, 'red-lined 'M-1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair. Only the Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment, though they still were woefully under-strength, as well as in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft to the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units). Due to public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, Truman decided to ask for Johnson's resignation. On September 19, 1950, Johnson resigned as Secretary of Defense, and the president quickly replaced him with General of the Army George C. Marshall. Armored warfare The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces was aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with fewanti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed. The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and the United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing Korean armor. The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including M4A3 Sherman medium tanks backed by U.S. M26 heavy tanks, along with British Centurion, Churchill, and Cromwell tanks. The U.S. landings at Inchon on 15 September cut off the North Korean supply lines, causing their armored forces and infantry to run out of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. As a result, the North Koreans had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned. By the time the North Koreans withdrew from the South, a total of 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76s were lost. After November 1950, North Korean armor was rarely encountered. Following the initial assault by the north, the Korean War saw limited use of tanks and featured no large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the Eastern Central Zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility. Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.

A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Juneau, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Jamaica, and the frigate HMS Black Swan fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them. USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea. Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea. The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces. During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to United States and UN navy ships was from magnetic mine s. During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug. Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage. Aerial warfare Further information: MiG Alley, USAF Units and Aircraft of the Korean War, and Korean People's Air Force The Korean War was the first war in which jet aircraft played the central role in air combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury--all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II--relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea's prop-driven air force of Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s. The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) of North Korea with the MiG-15, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters. The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and so could reach and destroy U.S. B-29 Superfortress bomber flights despite their fighter escorts. With increasing B-29 losses, the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to a safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets. A B-29 Superfortress bomber dropping its bombs. The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the F-86 Sabre. These arrived in December 1950. The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor. It had a very high service ceiling--15,000 m (50,000 ft) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons. The F-86 had a ceiling of13,000 m (42,000 ft) and were armed with six. 50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, which were range adjusted by radar gunsights. If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG. Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around1,100 km/ h (660 mph). The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better. In summer and autumn 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing--only 44 at one point--continued seeking battle in MiG Alley, where the Yalu River marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft. Following Colonel Harrison Thyng's communication with the Pentagon, the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued. A US Navy Sikorsky HO4S flying near USS Sicily Unlike the Vietnam War, in which the Soviet Union only officially sent ``advisers'', in the Korean aerial war Soviet forces participated via the 64th Airborne Corps. Fearful of confronting the United States directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union, and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.1,106 enemy airplanes were officially downed by the Soviet pilots, 52 of whom got ace status. The Soviet system of confirming air kills erred on the conservative side; the pilot's words had to be corroborated and enemy aircraft falling into the sea were not counted, the number might exceed1,106. After the war, and to the present day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre kill ratio in excess of 10: 1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire. The Soviet Air Force reported some1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively. However, one source claims that the U.S. Air Force has more recently cited 224 losses (c. 100 to air combat) out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea. The Korean War marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for rotorcraft, featuring the first large-scale deployment of helicopters for medical evacuation (medevac). In 1944--1945, during the Second World War, the YR-4 helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle, helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the AH-1 Cobra and other helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War (1965--75). Bombing of North Korea The first major U.S. strategic bombing campaign against North Korea, begun in late July 1950, was conceived as similar to the major offensives of World War II. On 12 August 1950, the U.S. Air Force dropped 625 tons of bombs on North Korea; two weeks later, the daily tonnage increased to some 800 tons. Following the intervention of the Chinese in November, General MacArthur ordered increased bombing campaign on North Korea which included incendiary attacks against their arsenals and communications centers and especially against the ``Korean end'' of all the bridges across the Yalu River. As with the aerial bombing campaigns over Germany and Japan in World War II, the nominal objective of the U.S. Air Force was to destroy North Korea's war infrastructure and shatter their morale. After MacArthur was removed as Supreme Commander in Korea in April 1951, his successors continued this policy and ultimately extended it to all of North Korea. The U.S. dropped a total of635,000 tons of bombs, including32,557 tons of napalm, on Korea, more than during the whole Pacific campaign of World War II. A USAF Douglas B-26B Invader of the 452nd Bombardment Wing bombing a target in North Korea, 29 May 1951. Almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed as a result. The war's highest-ranking U.S. POW, U.S. Major General William F. Dean, reported that the majority of North Korean cities and villages he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wasteland. North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground, and air defenses were ``non-existent.'' In November 1950, the North Korean leadership instructed their population to build dugouts and mud huts and to dig underground tunnels, in order to solve the acute housing problem. U.S. Air Force General Curtis LeMay commented, ``we went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea anyway, some way or another, and some in South Korea, too.'' Pyongyang, which saw 75 percent of its area destroyed, was so devastated that bombing was halted as there were no longer any worthy targets. On 28 November, Bomber Command reported on the campaign's progress: 95 percent of Manpojin was destroyed, along with 90 percent of Hoeryong, Namsi and Koindong, 85 percent of Chosan, 75 percent of both Sakchu and Huichon, and 20 percent of Uiju. According to USAF damage assessments, ``eighteen of twenty-two major cities in North Korea had been at least half obliterated.'' By the end of the campaign, US bombers had difficulty in finding targets and were reduced to bombing footbridges or jettisoning their bombs into the sea. As well as conventional bombing, the Communist side claimed that the U.S. used biological weapons. These claims have been disputed; Conrad Crane asserts that while the U.S. worked towards developing chemical and biological weapons, the U.S. military ``possessed neither the ability, nor the will'', to use them in combat. U.S. threat of atomic warfare Mark 4 bomb, seen on display, transferred to the 9th Bombardment Wing, Heavy On 5 November 1950, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. The President ordered the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs ``to the Air Force's Ninth Bomb Group, the designated carrier of the weapons... (and) signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets'', which he never transmitted. Many U.S. officials viewed the deployment of nuclear-capable (but not nuclear-armed) B-29 bombers to Britain as helping to resolve the Berlin Blockade of 1948--1949. Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military. During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war. By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their cores), to remind the Soviets of U.S. offensive ability. Deployment of a similar fleet to Guam was leaked to The New York Times. As United Nations forces retreated to Pusan, and the CIA reported that mainland China was building up forces for a possible invasion of Taiwan, the Pentagon believed that Congress and the public would demand using nuclear weapons if the situation in Korea required them. As Chinese forces pushed back the United States forces from the Yalu River, Truman stated during a 30 November 1950 press conference that using nuclear weapons was ``always (under) active consideration'', with control under the local military commander. The Indian ambassador, K. Madhava Panikkar, reports ``that Truman announced he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed unmoved by this threat... The PRC's propaganda against the U.S. was stepped up. The ``Aid Korea to resist America'' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control overanti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities.'' After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee, French Premier Ren\u00e9 Pleven, and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The United States 'forgoing atomic warfare was not because of ``a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate'' the Korean War, but because UN allies--notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France--were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the United States fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the United States would use nuclear weapons only if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or to prevent a ``major military disaster''. On 6 December 1950, after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN Command armies from northern North Korea, General J. Lawton Collins (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral C. Turner Joy, General George E. Stratemeyer, and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General Charles A. Willoughby, and Major General Edwin K. Wright met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassing the next weeks and months of warfare. In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command was forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without ROC reinforcements, and without an increase in U.S. forces until April 1951 (four National Guard divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea. In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command blockaded China and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the ROC soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea. In the third scenario: if China agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The U.S. Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul--Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice. Both the Pentagon and the State Department were cautious about using nuclear weapons because of the risk of general war with China and the diplomatic ramifications. Truman and his senior advisors agreed, and never seriously considered using them in early December 1950 despite the poor military situation in Korea. In 1951, the U.S. escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, ``lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores''. In October 1951, the United States effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish a nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east-central Japan. Hudson Harbor tested ``actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming''. The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the ``timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare.'' Ridgway was authorized to use nuclear weapons if a major air attack originated from outside Korea. An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China. The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential U.S. use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea. The B-29s returned to the United States in June. Despite the greater destructive power deploying atomic weapons would bring to the war, their effects on determining the war's outcome would have likely been minimal. Tactically, given the dispersed nature of Chinese and North Korean forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to mobilize and move forces. Strategically, attacking Chinese cities to destroy civilian industry and infrastructure would cause the immediate dispersion of the leadership away from such areas and give propaganda value for the communists to galvanize the support of Chinese civilians. Since the Soviets were not expected to intervene with their few primitive atomic weapons on China or North Korea's behalf if the U.S. used theirs first, factors such as little operational value and the lowering of the ``threshold'' for using atomic weapons againstnon-nuclear states in future conflicts played more of a role in not employing them than the threat of a possible nuclear exchange. When Eisenhower succeeded Truman in early 1953 he was similarly cautious about using nuclear weapons in Korea, including for diplomatic purposes to encourage progress in ongoing truce discussions. The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, the new president feared doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan. The war ended as it began, without U.S. nuclear weapons deployed near battle. War crimes Civilian deaths and massacres Further information: Bodo League massacre, Seoul National University Hospital massacre, No Gun Ri Massacre, Sinchon Massacre, Ganghwa massacre, Sancheong-Hamyang massacre, and Geochang massacre South Korean soldiers walk among the bodies of political prisoners executed near Daejon, July 1950 Civilians killed during a night battle near Yongsan, August 1950 There were numerous atrocities and massacres of civilians throughout the Korean war committed by both the North and South Koreans. Many started on the first days of the war. South Korean President Syngman Rhee ordered the Bodo League massacre on 28 June, beginning numerous killings of more than100,000 suspected leftist sympathizers and their families by South Korean officials and right-wing groups. During the massacre, the British protested to their allies and saved some citizens. In occupied areas, North Korean Army political officers purged South Korean society of its intelligentsia by executing every educated person--academic, governmental, religious--who might lead resistance against the North; the purges continued during the NPA retreat. When the North Koreans retreated north in September 1950, they abducted tens of thousands of South Korean men. The reasons are not clear, but the intention might have been to acquire skilled professionals to the North. In addition to conventional military operations, North Korean soldiers fought the UN forces by infiltrating guerrillas among refugees. These soldiers disguised as refugees would approach UN forces asking for food and help, then open fire and attack. U.S. troops acted under a ``shoot-first-ask-questions-later'' policy against any civilian refugee approaching U.S. battlefield positions, a policy that led U.S. soldiers to kill an estimated 400 civilians at No Gun Ri (26--29 July 1950) in central Korea because they believed some of the refugees to be North Korean soldiers in disguise. The South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission defended this policy as a ``military necessity''. Beginning in 2005, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission has investigated numerous atrocities committed by the Japanese colonial government, North Korean military, U.S. military, and the authoritarian South Korean government. It has investigated atrocities before, during and after the Korean War. The Commission verified over14,000 civilians were killed in the Jeju uprising (1948--49) that involved South Korean military and paramilitary units againstpro-North Korean guerrillas. Although most of the fighting subsided by 1949, it continued until 1950. The Commission estimates 86% of the civilians were killed by South Korean forces. The Americans on the island documented the events, but never intervened. Prisoners of War See also: Korean POWs detained in North Korea, Hill 303 massacre, and List of American and British defectors in the Korean War A U.S. Marine guards North Korean prisoners of war aboard an American warship in 1951. Chinese POW At Geoje prison camp on Geoje Island, Chinese POWs experiencedanti-communist lecturing and missionary work from secret agents from the U.S. and Taiwan in No. 71, 72 and 86 camps. ButPro-Communist POW experienced torture, cutting out limbs, or executed in public. Being forced to write confession letters and tattoo ofAnti-Communism slogan, and Flag of the Republic of China are also commonly seen, in case any want to go back to mainland China.Pro-Communist POW who could not endure the torture also formed an underground group to fight thePro-Nationalist POW secretly by assassination which led to the Geoje Uprising in the end. The rebellion captured Francis Dodd, and was cracked down by the 187th Infantry Regiment. In the end,14,235 Chinese POW went to Nationalist China (Taiwan) and less than6,000 POW went back to Mainland China. Those who went to Taiwan are called ``righteous men'' but experienced brainwash again and sent to the army or arrested; while the survivor who went back to Mainland China were also welcomed as ``hero'' first, but experiencedanti-brainwash, strict interrogation, and house arrest eventually, after the tattoo were found out. After 1988, Taiwanese government allowed POW to go back to Mainland China, and helped to cleananti-communist tattoo; while Chinese Government started to accept old POW return to Mainland China from Taiwan. UN Command POW During the first days of the war North Korean soldiers committed the Seoul National University Hospital massacre. The United States reported that North Korea mistreated prisoners of war: soldiers were beaten, starved, put to forced labor, marched to death, and summarily executed. The KPA killed POWs at the battles for Hill 312, Hill 303, the Pusan Perimeter, and Daejeon; these massacres were discovered afterwards by the UN forces. Later, a U.S. Congress war crimes investigation, the United States Senate Subcommittee on Korean War Atrocities of the Permanent Subcommittee of the Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations, reported that ``two-thirds of all American prisoners of war in Korea died as a result of war crimes''. Although the Chinese rarely executed prisoners like their North Korean counterparts, mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run POW camps during the winter of 1950--51. About 43 percent of U.S. POWs died during this period. The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to logistical difficulties. The UN POWs said that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that the Chinese withheld food to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs. According to Chinese reports, over a thousand U.S. POWs died by the end of June 1951, while a dozen British POWs died, and all Turkish POW survived. According to Hastings, wounded U.S. POWs died for lack of medical attention and were fed a diet of corn and millet ``devoid of vegetables, almost barren of proteins, minerals, or vitamins'' with only 1/ 3 the calories of their usual diet. Especially in early 1951, thousands of prisoners lost the will to live and ``declined to eat the mess of sorghum and rice they were provided.'' Two Hill 303 survivors after being rescued by U.S. units, 17 August 1950. The unpreparedness of U.S. POWs to resist heavy communist indoctrination during the Korean War led to the Code of the United States Fighting Force which governs how U.S. military personnel in combat should act when they must ``evade capture, resist while a prisoner or escape from the enemy''. North Korea may have detained up to50,000 South Korean POWs after the ceasefire. Over88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists 'claimed they captured70,000 South Koreans. However, when ceasefire negotiations began in 1951, the Communists reported they held only8,000 South Koreans. The UN Command protested the discrepancies and alleged that the Communists were forcing South Korean POWs to join the KPA. The Communist side denied such allegations. They claimed their POW rosters were small because many POWs were killed in UN air raids and that they had released ROK soldiers at the front. They insisted only volunteers were allowed to serve in the KPA. By early 1952, UN negotiators gave up trying to get back the missing South Koreans. The POW exchange proceeded without access to South Korean POWs not on the Communist rosters. North Korea continued to claim that any South Korean POW who stayed in the North did so voluntarily. However, since 1994, South Korean POWs have been escaping North Korea on their own after decades of captivity. As of 2010, the South Korean Ministry of Unification reported that 79 ROK POWs escaped the North. The South Korean government estimates 500 South Korean POWs continue to be detained in North Korea. The escaped POWs have testified about their treatment and written memoirs about their lives in North Korea. They report they were not told about the POW exchange procedures, and were assigned to work in mines in the remote northeastern regions near the Chinese and Russian border. Declassified Soviet Foreign Ministry documents corroborate such testimony. In 1997, the Geoje POW Camp in South Korea was turned into a memorial. Starvation See also: National Defense Corps Incident In December 1950, National Defense Corps was founded; the soldiers were406,000 drafted citizens. In the winter of 1951,50,000 to90,000 South Korean National Defense Corps soldiers starved to death while marching southward under the Chinese offensive when their commanding officers embezzled funds earmarked for their food. This event is called the National Defense Corps Incident. There is no evidence that Syngman Rhee was personally involved in or benefited from the corruption. Recreation Further information: United Service Organizations Bob Hope entertained X Corps in Korea on 26 October 1950. In 1950, Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall and Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews called on the USO which was disbanded by 1947 to provide support for U.S. servicemen. By the end of the war, more than113,000 USO volunteers from the U.S. were working at home front and abroad. Many stars came to Korea to give their performances. Throughout the Korean War, UN Comfort Stations were operated by South Korean officials for UN soldiers. Aftermath Main article: Aftermath of the Korean War The Korean Peninsula at night, shown in a 2012 composite photograph from NASA. Postwar recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea stagnated in the first postwar decade. In 1953, South Korea and the United States concluded a Mutual Defense Treaty. In 1960, the April Revolution occurred and students joined ananti-Syngman Rhee demonstration; 142 were killed by police; in consequence Syngman Rhee resigned and left for exile in the United States. Park Chung-hee's May 16 coup enabled social stability. In the 1960s, prostitution and related services earned 25 percent of South Korean GNP. From 1965 to 1973, South Korea dispatched troops to Vietnam and received$235,560,000 allowance and military procurement from the United States. GNP increased fivefold during the Vietnam War. South Korea industrialized and modernized. Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped. South Korea had one of the world's fastest-growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. In 1957 South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana, and by 2010 it was ranked thirteenth in the world (Ghana was 86th). Following extensive USAF bombing, North Korea ``had been virtually destroyed as an industrial society.'' After the armistice, Kim Il-Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance. In September 1953, the Soviet government agreed to ``cancel or postpone repayment for all... outstanding debts'', and promised to grant North Korea one billion rubles in monetary aid, industrial equipment and consumer goods. Eastern European members of the Soviet Bloc also contributed with ``logistical support, technical aid, (and) medical supplies.'' China canceled North Korea's war debts, provided 800 million yuan, promised trade cooperation, and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure. Postwar, about100,000 North Koreans were executed in purges. According to Rummel, forced labor and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in North Korea from 1945 to 1987; others have estimated400,000 deaths in concentration camps alone. Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that240,000 to420,000 people died as a result of the 1990s North Korean famine and that there were600,000 to850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008. A study by South Korean anthropologists of North Korean children who had defected to China found that 18-year-old males were 13 centimetres (5 in) shorter than South Koreans their age because of malnutrition. South Koreananti-Americanism after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of U.S. military personnel (USFK) and U.S. support for the authoritarian regime, a fact still evident during the country's democratic transition in the 1980s. However,anti-Americanism has declined significantly in South Korea in recent years, from 46% favorable in 2003 to 74% favorable in 2011, making South Korea one of the mostpro-U.S. countries in the world. In addition, a large number of mixed-race ``G.I. babies'' (offspring of U.S. and other UN soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country's orphanages. Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society. International adoption of Korean children began in 1954. The U.S. Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization ofnon-blacks andnon-whites as U.S. citizens, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy towardnon-Europeans, Koreans became one of the fastest-growing Asian groups in the United States. Mao Zedong's decision to take on the United States in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongestanti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War. Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after the United States entered the Korean War, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power. Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside Mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakeninganti-Communist dissent. North Koreans touring the Museum of American War Atrocities in 2009 The Chinese government have encouraged the point of view that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Joseph Stalin to enter the war. In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party. The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day. Mao had also discovered the usefulness of large-scale mass movements in the war while implementing them among most of his ruling measures over PRC. Finally,anti-U.S. sentiments, which were already a significant factor during the Chinese Civil War, was ingrained into Chinese culture during the Communist propaganda campaigns of the Korean War. The Korean War affected other participant combatants. Turkey, for example, entered NATO in 1952, and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea.

                    "context": "List of international cricket centuries by Virat Kohli-wikipedia List of international cricket centuries by Virat Kohli Jump to: navigation, search Kohli has made 49 centuries for India Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the national team. A right-handed middle order batsman, he has made 49 centuries in international cricket--17 in Test cricket and 32 in One Day Internationals (ODI)--as of October 2017. In a 2013 interview, former West Indies cricketer Vivian Richards described Kohli as someone whose batting reminds him of himself. Kohli made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008, and scored his first century the following year when he made 107 against the same team at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. His 86-ball 133 not out against Sri Lanka in February 2012 led India to the second highest run-chase by any team in Australia. Former Australian cricketer Dean Jones described the innings as ``one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time''. Kohli's highest score of 183 came against Pakistan during the 2012 Asia Cup; India successfully chased a target of 330 set by Pakistan and Kohli was adjudged man of the match. Following that in 2013, he made his first century as a captain while playing against the West Indies in atri-nation tournament. In the bilateral series against Australia in October 2013, Kohli made two centuries in successful run chases. The first of the two, 100 not out, was scored off 52 balls and remains the fastest ODI century by an Indian. The next century, which came off 61 balls, remains the third-fastest by an Indian as of October 2017. Out of his 32 ODI centuries, 19 have come in the second innings, and India have lost only four ODIs when he made a century. As of October 2017, Kohli has the most ODI centuries for an active player and is only next to Sachin Tendulkar (49) in the all-time list. After making his Test debut against the West Indies in 2011, Kohli scored his first century in the format during the Australian tour in January 2012. In the first Test of the 2014--15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he made 115 and 141, and became the fourth Indian player to score centuries in both the innings of a Test match. He was appointed as the captain of the Test team during the series and became the first player to score centuries in each of his first three Test innings as captain. In 2016, Kohli scored three double centuries including a career-best 235 against England. He became the fifth player to score three or more double centuries in a calendar year. Ten of his seventeen centuries in the format have been scored at venues outside India. Since his debut Twenty20 International match in 2010, Kohli is yet to score a century in the format; his highest score in the format is 90 not out against Australia in 2016.

The match featured tournament hosts Portugal, who went into the match as favourites, and Greece, playing in only their second European Championship. It was the first time in a major international tournament where both finalists had also played in the opening game of the tournament. Both teams had qualified for the knockout stage from Group A of the tournament's group stage, with Greece winning 2--1 in the teams 'earlier meeting. Greece won the final 1--0, defying odds of 80--1 from the beginning of the tournament, with Angelos Charisteas scoring the winning goal in the 57th minute. While the dedication of the side and the victory were celebrated by their nation, Greece were dubbed by Barry Glendenning of The Guardian as ``the only underdogs in history that everyone wants to see get beaten''.

It is not to be confused with ByeFelicia. Ice Cube (pictured in 2012), who starred in andco-wrote the script for the 1995 film Friday, in which the phrase originated The phrase ``Bye, Felicia'' (actually spelled ``Felisha'' in the cast listing) came from a scene in the American stoner buddy crime comedy film Friday (1995). According to Ice Cube, who starred in the film andco-wrote its script, ``Bye, Felicia'' is ``the phrase 'to get anyone out of your face ','' and, as it was used in the Friday scene, is generally intended as a dismissive kiss-off. Popular culture (edit) The saying gained popularity and continues to be used, even by people who have never seen the film. In 2009, it entered the lexicon of RuPaul's Drag Race, an American reality competition television series. However, People said ``even that wouldn't necessarily account for the phrase extending beyond the cultures that would watch either Friday, Drag Race or both. (Seriously, just look how often people use it on Twitter.)'' Furthermore, the magazine said of the phrase, ``So when your square friend uses it, take a little bit of pleasure in knowing they're referencing a stoner comedy--or a drag reality show referencing a stoner comedy--even if they have no idea.'' In 2014, VH1 began airing a television show called Bye Felicia, and AmericanR&B-pop singer Jordin Sparks released a mixtape titled# ByeFelicia. According to Google Trends, the phrase reached its highest usage inmid-2015. On December 14, 2017, Robin Roberts, a host of ABC TV's Good Morning America, used the phrase to conclude a segment about Omarosa Manigault Newman's departure from the Trump administration staff.

A total of 33 recorded tropical cyclones have reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir--Simpson hurricane wind scale in the Atlantic Ocean north of the equator, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes of such intensity occur once every three years in this region on average. Only six times--in the 1932, 1933, 1961, 2005, 2007, and 2017 hurricane seasons--has more than one Category 5 recorded hurricane formed. Only in 2005 have more than two Category 5 hurricanes formed, and only in 2007 and 2017 did more than one make landfall at Category 5 strength. Contents (hide) 1 Background 2 Systems 3 Listed by month 4 Landfalls 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Background (edit) Saffir--Simpson hurricane wind scale TD TS C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 Tracks of all known Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2014 A Category 5 Atlantic hurricane is one that is considered by the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC), to have had sustained wind speeds greater than 136 knots (157 mph; 252 km/ h; 70 m/ s) on the Saffir--Simpson scale. The NHC considers sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute period at 10 metres (32.8 ft) above ground. These wind speeds are estimated by using a blend of data from a variety of sources, which include observations from nearby ships, reconnaissance aircraft, or automatic weather stations and pictures from various satellites. Between 1924 and 2017, 33 hurricanes were recorded at Category 5 strength. No Category 5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924. It can be presumed that earlier storms reached Category 5 strength over open waters, but the strongest winds were not measured. The anemometer, a device used for measuring wind speed, was invented in 1846. However, during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often blown away, leaving the hurricane's peak intensity unrecorded. For example, as the Great Beaufort Hurricane of 1879 struck North Carolina, the anemometer cups were blown away when indicating 138 mph (222 km/ h). A reanalysis of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or downgrade other Atlantic hurricanes currently listed at Categories 4 and 5. For example, the 1825 Santa Ana hurricane is suspected to have reached Category 5 strength. Furthermore, paleotempestological research aims to identify past major hurricanes by comparing sedimentary evidence of recent and past hurricane strikes. For example, a ``giant hurricane'' significantly more powerful than Hurricane Hattie (Category 5) has been identified in Belizean sediment, having struck the region sometime before 1500. An October Category 5 that hit Cuba in 1924 Officially, the decade with the most Category 5 hurricanes is 2000--2009, with eight Category 5 hurricanes having occurred: Isabel (2003), Ivan (2004), Emily (2005), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Wilma (2005), Dean (2007), and Felix (2007). The previous decades with the most Category 5 hurricanes were the 1930s and 1960s, with six occurring between 1930 and 1939 (before naming began). Nine Atlantic hurricanes--Camille, Allen, Andrew, Isabel, Ivan, Dean, Felix, Irma and Maria--reached Category 5 intensity on more than one occasion; that is, by reaching Category 5 intensity, weakening to a Category 4 or lower, and then becoming a Category 5 again. Such hurricanes have their dates shown together. Camille, Andrew, Dean, Felix, Irma, and Maria each attained Category 5 status twice during their lifespans. Allen, Isabel, and Ivan reached Category 5 intensity on three separate occasions. However, no Atlantic hurricane has reached Category 5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan. The November 1932 Cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a Category 5 (although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance, so this record may be somewhat suspect). Irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a Category 5 storm in the satellite era. Thirty-three Category 5s have been recorded in the Atlantic basin since 1851, when records began. Only one Category 5 has been recorded in July, eight in August, nineteen in September, five in October, and one in November. There have been no officially recorded June or off-season Category 5 hurricanes. The July and August Category 5s reached their high intensities in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. These are the areas most favorable for tropical cyclone development in those months. September sees the most Category 5 hurricanes. This coincides with the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which occurs in early September. September Category 5s reached their strengths in any of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and open Atlantic. These places are where September tropical cyclones are likely to form. Many of these hurricanes are either Cape Verde-type storms, which develop their strength by having a great deal of open water; or so-called Bahama busters, which intensify over the warm Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico. All six Category 5s in October and November reached their intensities in the western Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes strongly gravitate toward late in the season. This is due to the climatology of the area, which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm waters.

Most Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall because of their proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, as opposed to the westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category 5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity. Many of these systems made landfall shortly after weakening from a Category 5. This weakening can be caused by dry air near land, shallower waters due to shelving, interaction with land, or cooler waters near shore. In southern Florida, the return period for a Category 5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years. The following table lists these hurricanes by landfall intensity.

The Journal, along with its Asian and European editions, is published six days a week by Dow Jones& Company, a division of News Corp. The newspaper is published in the broadsheet format and online. The Wall Street Journal is the largest newspaper in the United States by circulation. According to News Corp, in its June 2017 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Journal had a circulation of about 2.277 million copies (including nearly1,270,000 digital subscriptions) as of June 2017, compared with USA Today's 1.7 million. The newspaper, which has won 40 Pulitzer Prizes through 2017, derives its name from Wall Street in the heart of the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The Journal has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser. The Journal also publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine WSJ, which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues as of 2014. The Journal launched an online version in 1996, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.

They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers 'Afternoon Letter. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph. In 1896, The ``Dow Jones Industrial Average'' was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the Journal's Review& Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow. Journalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around7,000 but climbed to50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting--a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, Barron's, America's premier financial weekly, was founded. Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007. The Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its ``What's News'' digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from33,000 in 1941 to 1.1 million at the time of Kilgore's death in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials. In 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States that ultimately put journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to ``Dow Jones Local Media Group''. 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including ``Factiva'', The Wall Street Journal Asia, The Wall Street Journal Europe, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and ``WSJ Weekend Edition''. In 2007 News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. WSJ., a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008. Internet expansion (edit) Further information: OpinionJournal.com A complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal's print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with980,000 paid subscribers. Since then, online subscribership has fallen, due in part to rising subscription costs, and was reported at400,000 in March 2010. In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal cost$119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was$22.99, or$275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers. Vladimir Putin with Journal correspondent Karen Elliott House in 2002 On November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and The Wall Street Journal released an app that would allow users to access content from the Wall Street Journal Online via their mobile phones. Many of The Wall Street Journal news stories are available through free online newspapers that subscribe to the Dow Jones syndicate. Pulitzer Prize--winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer web site. In September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising. In 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of$191,000, an average household net worth of$2.1 million, and an average age of 55. In 2007, the Journal launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival Financial Times. Design changes (edit) The nameplate is unique in having a period at the end. On September 5, 2006, the Journal included advertising on its front page for the first time. This followed the introduction of front-page advertising on the European and Asian editions in late 2005. After presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century--always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, ``What's News'' digest in the second and third, the ``A-hed'' feature story in the fourth (with 'hed 'being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column--the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12 inches while keeping the length at 22\u200b\u2044 inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18 million a year in newsprint costs across all The Wall Street Journal papers. This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the ``A-hed'' out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories). The paper still uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls, in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The Journal still heavily employs the use of caricatures, notably those of Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert. The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more ``lifestyle'' sections. The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997. News Corporation and news Corp (edit) On May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position. Three months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The US$5 billion sale added The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, financial network unit and London's The Times, and locally within New York, the New York Post, along with Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9). On December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation. In an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the Journal's news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent: A special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor. A 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long ``expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations''. Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when ``Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors 'approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you? 'Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.'' Murdoch eventually forced out Evans. In 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the Journal agreed to run ``articles'' featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising. The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice. As a result, the then Wall Street Journal Europe CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue. Since September 2011 all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created. The Journal, along with its parent Dow Jones& Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp. In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the Journal's editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced that layoffs and consolidation to its sections would take place. In the memo, the new format for the newspaper will have a ``Business& Finance'' section that will combine its current ``Business& Tech'' and ``Money& Investing'' sections. It will also include a new ``Life& Arts'' section that will combine its current ``Personal Journal'' and ``Arena'' sections. In addition, the current ``Greater New York'' coverage will be reduced and will move into the main section of paper. Features (edit) Since 1980, the Journal has been published in multiple sections. At one time, The Journal's page count averaged as much as 96 pages an issue, but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the Journal in 2009--10 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue. Regularly scheduled sections are: Section One--every day; corporate news, as well as political and economic reporting and the opinion pages Marketplace--Monday through Friday; coverage of health, technology, media, and marketing industries (the second section was launched June 23, 1980) Money and Investing--every day; covers and analyzes international financial markets (the third section was launched October 3, 1988) Personal Journal--published Tuesday through Thursday; covers personal investments, careers and cultural pursuits (the section was introduced April 9, 2002) Off Duty--published Saturdays in WSJ Weekend; focuses on fashion, food, design, travel and gear/ tech.

Friday Journal, formerly called First Weekend Journal: March 20, 1998. WSJ.com launched in April 1996. First three-section Journal: October 1988. First two-section Journal: June 1980. Editorial page and political stance (edit) Further information: The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board The Journal won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to Robert L. Bartley in 1980 and Joseph Rago in 2011; for criticism to Manuela Hoelterhoff in 1983 and Joe Morgenstern in 2005; and for commentary to Vermont Royster in 1984, Paul Gigot in 2000, Dorothy Rabinowitz in 2001, Bret Stephens in 2013, and Peggy Noonan in 2017. Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the Columbia Journalism Review criticized the Journal's editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. The Journal describes the history of its editorials: They are united by the mantra ``free markets and free people'', the principles, if you will, marked in the watershed year of 1776 by Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. So over the past century and into the next, the Journal stands for free trade and sound money; against confiscatory taxation and the ukases of kings and other collectivists; and for individual autonomy against dictators, bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities. If these principles sound unexceptionable in theory, applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversial. Its historical position was much the same. As former editor William H. Grimes wrote in 1951: On our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road. Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view. We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. People will say we are conservative or even reactionary. We are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one, we would say we are radical. Just as radical as the Christian doctrine. Each Thanksgiving the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled The Desolate Wilderness, and describes what the Pilgrims saw when they arrived at the Plymouth Colony. The second is titled And the Fair Land, and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, Vermont C. Royster, whose Christmas article In Hoc Anno Domini has appeared every December 25 since 1949. Economic views (edit) During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity. In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates. For example, the Journal was a major supporter of the Chinese yuan's peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the Chinese government about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China. The Journal's views compare with those of the British publication The Economist, with its emphasis on free markets. However, the Journal demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American budget deficit. (The Journal generally points to the lack of foreign growth, while business journals in Europe and Asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the United States). Political stance (edit) Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, being interviewed by the Journal The Journal's editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, are highly influential in American conservative circles. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958--1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972--2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis. Some of the Journal's former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase. The editorial board has long argued for apro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984, editorial, the board wrote: ``If Washington still wants to 'do something 'about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be open borders.'' This stand on immigration reform places the Journal in contrast to most conservative activists, politicians, and media publications for example National Review and The Washington Times, who favor heightened restrictions on immigration. The Journal's editorial page has been seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill. The Journal's editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy. The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal tends to reject widely held views on climate change--namely that it poses a major threat to human existence, is largely caused by fossil fuel emissions, and can be prevented through public policy. The Journal is regarded as a forum for climate change skeptics, publishing articles by scientists skeptical of the consensus position on climate change in its op-ed section, including several essays by Richard Lindzen of MIT. Similarly, the Journal has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change. According to a 2016 analysis, 14% of the guest editorials presented the results of ``mainstream climate science'', while the majority did not. Also, none of 201 editorials published in the WSJ since 1997 concede that the burning of fossil fuels was causing climate change. A 2015 study found The Wall Street Journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to taking the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit. On October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia. In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation. The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within the Wall Street Journal, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility. Bias in news pages (edit) The Journal's editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo argue the Journal's news pages have apro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of The Journal was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or The New York Times). The study did not factor in editorials. Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that ``... the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.'' (The authors assume that) ``think tank ideology (...) only matters to liberals.'' The company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to ``maintain the values and integrity of the Journal.'' Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes (edit) The Journal has won more than 30 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting. 1987: RJR Nabisco buyout (edit) In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO. 1988: Insider trading (edit) In the 1980s, then Journal reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg, who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his book, Den of Thieves. 1997: AIDS treatment (edit) David Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement. He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS. 2000: Enron (edit) Jonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of The Wall Street Journal, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000. Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly, and wrote a book, 24 Days. 2001: 9/ 11 (edit) The Journal claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers 'collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal's offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories. The Journal subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/ 11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from The Wall Street Journal bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated. It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. 2007: stock option scandal (edit) In 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic Gold Medal, for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value. 2008: Bear Stearns Fall (edit) Kate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns. 2010: McDonald's health Care (edit) A report published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report ``speculative and misleading'', stating they had no plans to drop coverage. The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets. 2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB (edit) In 2015, a report published by the Journal alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper. The report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation. 2015--present: Theranos investigation (edit) In 2015, a report written by the Journal's John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos 'technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors. According to Vanity Fair, ``a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham--that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors 'equipment.'' The Journal has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos 'and Holmes 'credibility.

As per the agreement, the cap was fixed did not vary with league revenue performance. The minimum team salary was set at$4,550,000 with individual minimum salaries set at$53,000. Free agency (edit) The 2017 free agency period began on Tuesday, February 14, 2017 at 12pm EST. All players eligible for free agency are unrestricted free agents, as is customary in the league. CFL week (edit) CFL Week 2017 logo. The league announced on November 15, 2016 that Regina, Saskatchewan would be host to the first ever CFL Week (branded as Mark's CFL Week), an event designed to engage fans and the media during the off-season. The event took place from March 20 to March 26, 2017 at Evraz Place. The week started with the Western Regional Combine, which Edmonton had hosted the past four years. The CFL National Combine took place from March 23 to March 25, showcasing 2017 CFL Draft-eligible prospects. The 2017 Canadian Football Hall of Fame inductees were announced during this week and the CFL and TSN photo shoot also took place here. There was also an interactive Fan Festival, a head coach and general manager media event, and the CFL Rules and Competition Committee meetings, which normally take place in February. The CFL also invited football teams from U Sports 'Canada West Universities Athletic Association in a skeleton football tournament as part of a football showcase. This was the first CFL Combine held outside of Toronto. Season schedule (edit) On February 7, 2017, the CFL released the 2017 season schedule with the Saskatchewan Roughriders visiting the Montreal Alouettes on June 22. The Alouettes most recently hosted the season-opening game in 2015. For the fourth consecutive season, week 1 featured a Grey Cup rematch, with the defending champion Ottawa Redblacks hosting the Calgary Stampeders. Those two teams also met in week 2 in Calgary in an extended rematch. Including that home-and-home series, there were five played in the season with Saskatchewan and Calgary playing in two each and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats having none. For the first time since Ottawa rejoined the league in 2014, allpre-season games were played against divisional opponents. Additionally, for the first time since the league expanded to an 81-game schedule in 2014, a team other than Toronto played two games in one week, with the Redblacks playing two games in week 5. There were 19 double headers, with nine on Fridays, nine on Saturdays, and one on Labour Day Monday, with the Ontario Labour Day game being played in prime time for the second consecutive year. There were four instances of overlaps for the Friday games as those nights featured games with 2.5 hours of start-time difference as opposed to the usual three hour difference. Those numbers do not include the triple header which was featured for the second consecutive year, although this time it occurred in week 12 on the Saturday before the 2017 NFL season week one Sunday games were played. For the second time in three years, there was only one game played on Thanksgiving Monday, with Montreal maintaining its customary hosting. This was the third straight season to showcase Thursday Night Football with the first 11 weeks featuring Thursday night games, although the hosting distribution was not as equal as it was in the previous year. The Montreal Alouettes hosted four Thursday night games, Winnipeg hosted three, Ottawa Redblacks hosted two, while two teams (Toronto and Calgary) hosted once and three teams (Hamilton, Saskatchewan, and BC) did not host any. Hall of Fame (edit) The Canadian Football Hall of Fame game took place on September 15, 2017, featuring the Hamilton Tiger-Cats hosting the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Kelvin Anderson, Anthony Calvillo, MikeO'Shea, and Geroy Simon were inducted as players while Stan Schwartz and Brian Towriss joined as builders.O'Shea is the currently the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, whose team had a bye that week, and he also played four seasons with the Tiger-Cats. Calvillo is the quarterbacks coach for the Alouettes, whose team played two days after the Hall of Fame game, and he also played for three years with the Tiger-Cats. Simon spent one year with the Roughriders and won the Grey Cup with the team that one year. Saskatchewan Roughriders new stadium (edit) After spending 95 years at the site of their old stadium, Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field, the Saskatchewan Roughriders moved into a brand new facility, also called Mosaic Stadium, for the 2017 season. The stadium has a fixed seating capacity of approximately33,000 that is expandable to40,000 for special events like the Grey Cup. The design of the stadium was unveiled on May 22, 2014 with the official groundbreaking ceremony being held on June 16, 2014. Mosaic Stadium was declared ``substantially completed'' on August 31, 2016 and a test event featuring a football game between the Regina Rams and Saskatchewan Huskies was held on October 1, 2016. The stadium was built for approximately$ 278 million with the city of Regina providing$73 million, the Saskatchewan provincial government providing a grant of$80 million and a loan of$100 million, and the Roughriders paying the rest. Unlike stadium delays in Winnipeg and Hamilton, Saskatchewan opened their new stadium on time, hosting the Bombers in the second week of the season. Broadcasting changes (edit) Inmid-June 2017 the CFL announced a new international streaming service branded as CFL International. The new service will expand coverage around the world to new markets including mainland Europe, Asia and Africa, totalling over 130 new countries. TSN retains the CFL broadcast rights in Canada, BT Sports in the United Kingdom, ESPN in the United States, South America, Australia and portions of both Southeast Asia and Africa. CFL International is provided via Yare Media Group Inc and is available in three different package options: Single game pass ($2.99 US), team pass ($36.99 US) and league pass ($79.99 US). Commissioner change (edit) On April 12, 2017 the Board of Governors and Jeffrey Orridge agreed to part ways, effective June 30, 2017. Orridge had been the commissioner of the league since April 2015 after taking over from Mark Cohon who served for eight years from 2007 though 2014. On June 15, 2017 the CFL announced that June 15 would be Orridge's last day in office, two weeks earlier than agreed upon back in April. Jim Lawson, the league's Chairman of the Board of Governors, assumed the duties of commissioner until a suitable replacement was found. On July 4, 2017, former CFL offensive lineman Randy Ambrosie assumed the position of commissioner. Having spent 9 seasons playing with the Calgary Stampeders, Toronto Argonauts and Edmonton Eskimos from 1985--1993, Ambrosie is the first commissioner to have played in the league since Larry Smith left the position in 1996. Front office changes (edit) Team 2016 GM 2017 GM Montreal Alouettes Jim Popp Kavis Reed Toronto Argonauts Jim Barker Jim Popp Edmonton Eskimos Ed Hervey Brock Sunderland On November 7, 2016, the Montreal Alouettes released their 21-year general manager and sometime Vice President and head coach Jim Popp after two disappointing seasons in a row. Popp joined the then brand-new Baltimore Stallions organization in 1994, and contributed to the revived Montreal team's current three Grey Cup championships and eight East Division titles over his tenure as general manager (as well as an additional Grey Cup and one South Division title in Baltimore); Popp was the last major legacy contributor from the CFL's American expansion of the 1990s. On December 14, 2016, the Alouettes held a press conference to announce Patrick Boivin as President and CEO and Kavis Reed as general manager. Reed had been the special teams coordinator with the Als for the previous two seasons, and has been coaching in the CFL since 2001. After six seasons as the general manager of the Argonauts and compiling a 49--59 record in that time span, Jim Barker was fired on January 24, 2017. On February 28, 2017 the Argos announced Jim Popp as their new general manager. Popp had been the GM of the Montreal Alouettes since themid-1990s and led the team to three Grey Cup championships. On April 7, 2017 the Eskimos held a press conference to announce the firing of general manager Ed Hervey. The decision was made in large part because of a contract dispute and philosophical differences regarding increasing the media and fan accessibility of the team. Hervey had been the GM since the 2013 CFL season, and had led the team to a record of 40-32 (3-2 in playoffs) during that time, including winning the 103rd Grey Cup. On April 25, 2017 the Eskimos named 37-year old Brock Sunderland as their new GM. Sunderland had been the assistant GM of the Ottawa Redblacks since their inaugural season in 2013. Coaching changes (edit) Team 2016 HC 2016 interim HC 2017 HC 2017 interim HC Montreal Alouettes Jim Popp Jacques Chapdelaine Kavis Reed Toronto Argonauts Scott Milanovich Marc Trestman Hamilton Tiger-Cats Kent Austin June Jones On December 14, 2016, the Montreal Alouettes announced that Jacques Chapdelaine would stay on as the team's head coach. Chapdelaine had served as the interim head coach for the final six games of the previous season. However, after a 3--8 start to the season the Alouettes announced that they had dismissed Chapdelaine and defensive coordinator Noel Thorpe. General Manager Kavis Reed will serve as the interim head coach until the end of the season. Reed was the head-coach of the Edmonton Eskimos for three seasons (2011-2013), winning 22 games, and losing 32 (1-2 in the playoffs). On January 27, 2017 Scott Milanovich resigned from his position as the head coach of the Toronto Argonauts; and later that day became the quarterbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL. Scott Milanovich had been the head coach of the Argos for five seasons starting in 2012, leading the club to a record of 43--47 during his tenure. Milanovich guided the Argos to victory in the 100th Grey Cup, his first season as head coach. On February 28, 2017 the Argos announced Marc Trestman as their new head coach. Trestman was the head coach of the Montreal Alouettes from 2008 through 2012, with a record of 59--31, guiding the Als to back-to-back Grey Cup titles in 2009 and 2010. On August 24, 2017, midway through the 2017 season, Kent Austin stepped down as the head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (remaining with the team as vice president of football operations), and named June Jones his successor. Austin was in his fifth season as the Ti-Cats head coach, but started the season 0--8. During his tenure the Hamilton the Tiger-Cats won 36 games and lost 44, they also lost in consecutive Grey Cups (2013& 2014). Jones had only been with the Ti-Cats for a little over three weeks at the time of his appointment to head coach, and his only other CFL coaching experience was with the Ottawa Rough Riders as their offensive coordinator in 1986. Nevertheless, he has extensive experience coaching in the NFL and various American collegiate levels. NFL--CFL Officiating Development Program (edit) On May 16, 2017 the CFL announced it would be renewing and expanding the officiating partnership as it enters into its second year of existence. Six NFL officials (two more than in 2016) will work as part of CFL crews during CFL preseason and regular-season games in June and July, prior to the start of the NFL season. Additionally, six CFL officials (three more than in 2016) will attend the NFL's Officiating Development Program. Rules changes (edit) In March the CFL's Rules Committee submitted a variety of rule changes to the Board of Governors, to be implemented for the 2017 season. The proposed changes focus on improving game flow and increasing player safety. The proposals will be reviewed by the CFL's Board of Governors. Proposed changes (edit) Coaches would no longer be allowed to challenge a play following a TV commercial timeout. The coach would have to throw his challenge flag within the first 30 seconds of the TV break. Limiting the types of actions which coaches can challenge with regards to ``roughing the passer'' penalties and hits on quarterbacks when they are running with the ball. Change all 10-yard illegal low block penalties to 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalties. Prevent the return team on a kicking play from putting a player on the field a split second prior to the snap and trying to hide him so he can receive a lateral pass from the kick returner. This sort of play would be subject to a 10-yard penalty. Increasing the duties of the video official in the Command Centre so they can correct errors when: A flag has been thrown for a line of scrimmage penalty (offside or procedure) A flag has been thrown for an unnecessary roughness penalty following a play and the video official sees other unnecessary roughness infractions A call for illegal contact on a receiver should be changed to defensive pass interference because the ball had been thrown The replay official can only a change a call where there is clear and indisputable evidence that it is wrong, rather than attempt to officiate plays to ensure they are correct. TSN will go to commercial on every challenge it can. It is estimated that 80% of challenges will now be done during a commercial, up from 20% last season. Retaining themid-season rule change from last season in which if a team makes its first coach's challenge of the game and does not win that challenge, the team losses a timeout.Mid-season rule changes (edit) On August 2, 2017 new Commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced that coaches would only be able to challenge once per game, instead of twice. This change came in response to the fans growing displeasure over the frequency and inconsistency of coaches challenges. The hope is that by only being able to challenge once per game teams will have to save their challenge for more egregious mistakes. On September 13, 2017 the CFL and CFLPA made two major announcements to address player safety. The first being the immediate end of fully padded-practices during the season. Under the previous rules each team was allowed to have 17 padded practices over the course of the season. Secondly, it was announced that starting in 2018, seasons would now be 21 weeks in length, one week longer than the 2017 season. This will allow more time between games for players to recover, and help alleviate scheduling issues in a nine-team league. Marketing (edit) On May 7, the league launched its ``Bring It In/ Tous Ensemble'' ad campaign, designed to diversify its fan base and attract more women and younger fans. On August 13, the league launched a suite of T-shirts with the moniker ``Diversity is Strength/ Diversit\u00e9 est synonyme de Force'' in response to the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia. The backs of the shirts had the last names of dozens of former and present CFL players from varying ethnic backgrounds. The shirts were originally planned to have been released in the fall, with the league moving the launch up to respond to the events in Charlottesville. Regular season (edit) Structure (edit) Teams played eighteen regular season games, playing two divisional opponents three times and all of the other teams twice. Teams were awarded two points for a win and one point for a tie. The top three teams in each division qualified for the playoffs, with the first place team gaining a bye to the divisional finals. A fourth place team in one division may qualify ahead of the third place team in the other division (the ``Crossover''), if they earn more points in the season. If two or more teams in the same division were equal in points, the following tiebreakers applied: If a third-place team finishes in a tie with the fourth place team in the other division, the third place team automatically gets the playoff spot and there is no crossover. Most wins in all games Head to head winning percentage (matches won divided by all matches played) Head to head points difference Head to head points ratio Tiebreakers 3--5 applied sequentially to all divisional games Tiebreakers 4 and 5 applied sequentially to all league games Coin toss Notes: 1. If two clubs remain tied after other club (s) are eliminated during any step, tie breakers reverts to step 2.

The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have reached nine NBA Finals, winning five NBA championships in 1947, 1956, 1975, 2015 and 2017. Golden State's five NBA championships are tied forfourth-most in NBA history with the San Antonio Spurs, and behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16) and Chicago Bulls (6). As of 2017, the Warriors are the third most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes, with an estimated value of$2.6 billion. The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname. The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of ``W's''. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have both been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards. 18 Hall of Famers have played for the Warriors, while four have coached the team. Golden State holds the NBA records for best regular season with 73--9, best postseason with 16--1(. 941 winning percentage) and most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined) with 88.

They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League. Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager. The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925. 1946--1962: Philadelphia Warriors Joe Fulks was the league's first scoring champion. Led by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946--47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship. Gottlieb bought the team in 1951. Wilt Chamberlain averaged 41.5 points per game and 25.1 rebounds per game during his five and a half seasons with the Warriors. The Warriors won its other championship in Philadelphia in the 1955--56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston. In 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'', he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior ``home'' game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments. 1962--1971: San Francisco Warriors In 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose. Nate Thurmond averaged over 20 points per game during five different seasons and over 20 rebounds per game during two seasons while with the Warriors. Prior to the 1963--64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964--65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and$150,000 and won only 17 games. In 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the 1966--67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers. Angered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967--68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970--71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors. 1971--1978 The Warriors '1974--75 championship banner. The franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971--72 season, in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California. Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971. Rick Barry (shown in 1976) was named the NBA Finals MVP in 1975. The Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974--75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named MVP of the finals. At 59-23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975--76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42-40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals. 1978--1987 Because of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks 'offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric ``Sleepy'' Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. (Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets). The departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft. 1987--1997 A ticket for a 1988--89 game between the Warriors and the Jazz. After a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. In the game, Warriors 'All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd's performance in the second half still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors. The ``Sleepy Floyd game'' was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson, who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as ``Run TMC'' after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). But ``Run TMC'' stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system, sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995. In 1993--94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs. At the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. 1994--95 was the first season under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995--96 season, and ended up with a 36--46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996--97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30--52 finish. Longtime Seton Hall college coach P.J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for 1997--98. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the 1997--98 season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline ``WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM'' and the declaration by GM Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. 1997--2008 St. Jean had become the new Warriors 'GM in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors 'struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself. St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and JermaineO'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors 'star scorer through the 2006--07 season. For a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002--03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors 'fans when the team was unable tore-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars. Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005--06 season, entering the new year with a plus. 500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114--109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons. 2006--07: ``We Believe'' season Entering the 2006--07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBAnon-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/ guard Stephen Jackson, guard \u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius and forward Josh Powell. This trade allowed the Warriors to ``run and gun'' their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106--107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26--35. March 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42--40) at 16--5 in their last 21 games. ``We Believe'' became the Warriors 'slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs. Led by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedri\u0146\u0161, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks 'expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis 'frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3& 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118--112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3--2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18--0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No. 8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular season series. The Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006--07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City. 2007--08 season The Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the 2007--08 season with six straight losses, but Ellis 'rise, Davis 'solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game), and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48--34 season, which is the best record in NBA history for anon-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging19,631 per game, the highest in team history. 2008--2011 In the offseason, Baron Davis opted to return to his home town and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of the 2008 NBA draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf andre-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 to long-term contracts. The Warriors had a disappointing 2008--2009 season, finishing 29--53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89. During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, was promoted in his place and drafted Stephen Curry as an outstanding 7th lottery pick, but dubiously traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton. The Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009--10. as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, making it their fifth D-League call-up that season, tying an NBA record. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year, and finished the season 26--56, fourth in the Pacific Division. On June 24, the Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their ``The City'' logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969--71 ``The City'' uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year,$80 million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets 'offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year,$11 million deal. On July 15, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record$450 million. On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka and Dennis Wong. The Warriors gathered together during the team's starting lineup ceremony prior to their 2011--12 exhibition opener against the Sacramento Kings. The Warriors continued their signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option, the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under$5 million inmid-September. Keith Smart was hired as head coach that same month after Nelson had resigned before the start of training camp. In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second-round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived. During a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors broke franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against the Orlando Magic. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 3's in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005--06. He then broke another NBA record, as the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. He ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most 3s attempted with 516, both of which set new Warrior franchise records. The Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36-win season in 2010--11, and coach Smart was dismissed on April 27 due to the change in ownership. 17-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced him as head coach on June 6. On December 19, they traded Amundson to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Brandon Rush. 2011--present: ``Splash Brothers'' era The ``Splash Brothers'': Stephen Curry (left) and Klay Thompson (right) The Warriors did not improve in the 2011--12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shorted season with a 23--43 record, 13th in the conference. The team suffered several injuries to key players, and due to the lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. They then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. Team leader Monta Ellis was traded inmid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to teamco-captains, and saw off-guard Klay Thompson, the 11th overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft, move into a starting role. On July 11, they acquired point guard Jarrett Jack from the New Orleans Hornets in a three-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers, who received Dorell Wright from Golden State. On August 1, they signed forward Carl Landry on the termination of his one-year contract with the Hornets. In the 2012 NBA draft, they selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green 35th overall, and 7-foot 1-inch center Ognjen Kuzmic 52nd overall. In early November, swingman Rush was lost for the year with a torn ACL after falling awkwardly on the court early in the second game of the season, and less than a month later the team announced that Bogut was out indefinitely with a foot injury that was more serious than originally reported. Bogut did not return to regular play until late in the season. Coming out of this maelstrom of trades and injuries with a team starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the Warriors had one of their best starts in decades, earning their 20th win before hitting the 30-game mark for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6--1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97--95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006--07 ``We believe'' Warriors. This time, the local battlecry was ``we belong''. The team finished the season with a record of 47--35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut. Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets to set an NBA single-season record, giving him the nickname ``baby-faced assassin'', and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection, dating back to Latrell Sprewell in the 1997 season. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the ``Splash Brothers'' by team employee Brian Witt for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995--96. 2013--14: improvements With their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round. In early July 2013, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and free agent Andre Iguodala to a four-year,$48 million deal. To make room under their salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedrins and Brandon Rush, along with multiple draft picks, including their 2014 and 2017 first-round picks, to the Utah Jazz. The Warriors lost free-agent guard Jarrett Jack, who departed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and free agent power forward Carl Landry, who went to the Sacramento Kings. To help fill the void left by Landry, the Warriors signed forward-center Marreese Speights to a three-year,$10 million contract. The team also signed one-year deals with veteran center JermaineO'Neal ($2 million) and point guard Toney Douglas ($1.6 million). On August 21, the Warriors signed 7 ft 1 in Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic, who had been playing in Europe since his selection in the 2012 NBA draft, to a guaranteed two-year deal. The Warriors began the 2013--14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12--9, as compared to 17--4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Festus Ezeli (off-season surgery to repair the right knee, out for the season), Toney Douglas (left tibia stress reaction, out nearly a month frommid-November to December), and JermaineO'Neal (right wrist injury and surgery, out frommid-November to early February). Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes were also out for at least four games before the all-star break, each with minor injuries. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month, during which time the Warriors 'performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court, and the team posted a losing 5--7 record while revealing a lack of depth on their bench. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak, which included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and just one short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins, set in the 1971--72 season. To strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake. Thanks in part to the improved effectiveness of their backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old JermaineO'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112--95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of thepost-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors 'playoff hopes. The Warriors ended the season 51--31, winning more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finishing 20 games over. 500 for the first time in 22 years, and tying the 1991--92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, in the first round of the playoffs the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game, which the Warriors lost, bringing their 2013--14 season to an end. It was season of many thrilling moments in which the Warriors 'played in 17 regular-season games decided by 2 points or less, 6 games with winning shots in the final 3 seconds, and 7 comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more. In other noteworthy occurrences for the season, Curry was named to the starting lineup for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. For Curry, the only Warrior named to the team, this was his first all-star appearance in five seasons as an NBA player. Curry hit another notable milestone in posting 4 triple-doubles for the season, tying a franchise record unequaled since Wilt Chamberlain in 1963--64. Curry also averaged career-bests in points and assists; averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists in the season. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. On February 7, in a 102--87 win over the Chicago Bulls, the backcourt duo became the first teammates to each make a three-pointer in 30 consecutive games. Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by Seattle Supersonic Ray Allen in 2004--05 and 2005--06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before. 2014--15: from turmoil to champions Even as the team rolled towards thepost-season, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors 'front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a ``difference in philosophies'' and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called ``an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere'' on the Warriors 'coaching staff. Fewer than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players. During the post season, rumors persisted in the press that Mark Jackson's job as head coach was in jeopardy, leading the players to make a unanimous declaration of support for Jackson's return only minutes after the Warriors 'first-round, game seven playoff loss to the Clippers. Nonetheless, three days later, on May 6, the team announced the firing of Mark Jackson as head coach. In his three-season tenure as head coach, Jackson compiled a 121-109(. 526) record, overseeing a terrific turnaround. When Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had made the playoffs only one time over the prior 17 seasons, averaging 30.2 wins per season during that period. Jackson, 49, became just the third head coach in franchise history to lead a team to at least 50 wins in a season, joining Don Nelson and Alvin Attles, who both hit the mark twice with the Warriors. With 121 wins overall, Jackson ranks fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Attles (557), Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263). On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr the team's head coach in a reported$25 million deal over five years. It was a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting(. 454). Kerr formerly served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). The Warriors completed the regular season with a record of 67-15, the best in the league and the most wins in franchise history. The Warriors also finished with a home record of 39--2, the second best in NBA history. They were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014--15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior to do so since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the New Orleans Pelicans, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in the second round in six games and defeated Houston Rockets in five games of the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win their fourth NBA title, and their first in 40 years. Andre Iguodala was named Finals MVP. Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014--15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award. 2015--16: broken records Draymond Green was an All-NBA Second Team member in 2015--16 The Warriors began the season by winning their first 24 games, eclipsing the previous best start in NBA history, set by the 1993--94 Houston Rockets and the 1948--49 Washington Capitols at 15--0. The Warriors surpassed the 1969--70 New York Knicks for the best road start in NBA history at 14--0, which is also the joint-third longest road win streak. Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015. The Warriors broke a 131-year-old record of 20--0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014--15 season, eclipsing the 2012--13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history. The team set an NBA record 54-straight regular season home game winning streak, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016. The previous record of 44 was held by the 1995--96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan. Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time the Warriors have had three All-Stars since 1976. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant. On April 13, 2016, Golden State set the record for most wins in a single season, beating Memphis, and finishing 73-9. On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes. The Golden State Warriors went to their second consecutive appearance in the finals with a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors went to a 3-1 advantage but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at 3 wins apiece. In Game 7 the Golden State Warriors lost the championship series on their homecourt, and earned the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first team to blow a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals. 2016--present: the ``fantastic four'' era On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he would leave the Oklahoma City Thunder in order to sign a 2-year contract with the Golden State Warriors. On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team. The Durant signing made the Warriors the prohibitive favorites to win the NBA championship, according to oddsmakers. The Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016--17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13 in a 116-106 win over the Pelicans. On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes in a 142--106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars. On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points. On March 2, 2017, the Warriors 'streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94--87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz. The Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016--17 regular season record of 67--15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12--0, defeating in order the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4--1 in the Finals, and their 16--1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage(. 941) in NBA playoffs history. Move from Oakland back to San Francisco In April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new18,000-seat arena which is expected to be ready for the 2019-20 NBA season, with construction to begin in early 2016. The sale was finalized in October 2015. The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views. The new location, which still faces some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site. Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/ BART station. The Golden State Warriors may consider a concurrent name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, although the team's recent success has them reconsidering that decision. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors 'new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JP Morgan Chase. Rivalries Cleveland Cavaliers Main article: Cavaliers--Warriors rivalry Media Television Bob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warrior guard Jim Barnett has done color commentary for the Warriors for more than 15 years, currently on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year. They also host Roundtable Live, a half-hourpre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games. Fitzgerald is in his 16th season as the Warriors 'play-by-play man, while Barnett is in his 27th season as color man. Greg Papa, Garry St. Jean, and Kelenna Azubuike are also members of the telecast team, specializing in in-game, halftime andpost-game analysis, while Rosalyn Gold-Onwude serves as the sideline reporter. Radio Tim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. On August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ. After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together forpost-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.

For entries in the franchise, see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (disambiguation). Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Art by Kevin Eastman Publication information Publisher Mirage Studios First appearance Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles# 1 (May 1984) Created by Kevin Eastman Peter Laird In-story information Base (s) Manhattan, New York City Member (s) Leonardo Donatello Michelangelo Raphael The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (often shortened to TMNT or Ninja Turtles) are four fictional teenaged anthropomorphic turtles named after Italian artists of the Renaissance. They were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the art of ninjutsu. From their home in the sewers of New York City, they battle petty criminals, evil overlords, mutated creatures, and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society. They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The characters originated in comic books published by Mirage Studios and expanded into cartoon series, films, video games, toys, and other merchandise. During the peak of the franchise's popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it gained worldwide success and fame.

The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and bad television with Laird. Using money from a tax refund, together with a loan from Eastman's uncle, the young artists self-published a single-issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel Comics 'Daredevil and New Mutants, Dave Sim's Cerebus, and Frank Miller's Ronin. The TMNT comic book series has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984. The Turtles started their rise to mainstream success when a licensing agent, Mark Freedman, sought out Eastman and Laird to propose wider merchandising opportunities for the franchise. In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures produced a set of 15-mm (approximately 0.6 inch) lead figurines. In January 1987, Eastman and Laird visited the offices of Playmates Toys, a small California toy company that wanted to expand into the action-figure market. Development was undertaken by a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, advertising agent of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson headed by Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with the Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian, vice president (VP) of sales Richard Sallis, and VP of Playmates Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteur and writer John C. Schulte, and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high concept pitch ``Green Against Brick''. The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of the Murakami-Wolf-Swenson animation firm's writers. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launched to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like ``Heroes in a half shell'' and many of the comical catch phrases and battle cries (``Turtle power!'') came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill, and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts. The miniseries was repeated three times before it found an audience. Once the product started selling, the show got syndicated and picked up and backed by Group W, which funded the next round of animation. The show then went network, on CBS. Accompanied by the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987 TV series, and the subsequent action figure line, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a mainstream success. At the height of the frenzy, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Turtles 'likenesses could be found on a wide range of children's merchandise, from Pez dispensers to skateboards, breakfast cereal, video games, school supplies, linens, towels, cameras, and toy shaving kits. While the animated TV series, which lasted for 10 seasons until 1996, was more light-hearted, the comic-book series continued in a much darker and grittier tone. In 1990, a live-action feature film was released, with the Turtles and Splinter being portrayed by actors in partially animatronic suits created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The film became one of the most successful independent films and spawned two sequels, as well as inspiring a three-dimensional animated film set in the same continuity, which was released in 2007 under the title TMNT. After the end of the cartoon series, a live-action series in the vein of the films was created in 1997 in conjunction with Saban Entertainment. The series was called Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation and introduced a fifth, female turtle called Venus de Milo. However, the series was largely unsuccessful and was canceled after one season. The property lay dormant until 2003, when a new animated TV series also entitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles began to air on Fox Box (4Kids TV). The series storyline stuck much closer to the original Mirage comic book series, but was still less violent. It lasted for seven seasons and 156 episodes, ending in February 2009. On October 21, 2009, it was announced that cable channel Nickelodeon (a subsidiary of Viacom) had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property. Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown. Nickelodeon has developed a new CGI-animated TMNT television series and partnered with fellow Viacom company Paramount Pictures to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters. The TV show premiered on Nickelodeon on September 29, 2012. The live-action film, produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies, and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman, and produced by Michael Bay, was released on August 8, 2014. Main characters (edit) Main article: List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters Leonardo (Leo)--The tactical, courageous leader and devoted student of his sensei, Leonardo wears a blue mask and wields two ninjatos, commonly confused by fans and writers as katanas. As the most conscientious of the four, he often bears the burden of responsibility for his brothers, which commonly leads to conflict with Raphael. Leonardo was named after the Italian polymath, painter, engineer, inventor, writer, anatomist, and sculptor, Leonardo da Vinci. Michelangelo (Mikey or Mike)--The most stereotypical teenager of the team, Michelangelo is a free-spirited, relaxed, goofy and jokester, known for his love of pizza. Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of nunchucks. He provides the comic relief, though he still has an adventurous side. The least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a ``surfer'' type and is often depicted with a Southern Californian accent. He is named after the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer, Michelangelo. His name was originally misspelled ``Michaelangelo'' by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. Donatello (Donnie or Don)--The scientist, inventor, engineer, and technological genius, Donatello wears a purple mask and wields a bo staff. Donatello is perhaps the least violent turtle, preferring to use his knowledge to solve conflicts, but never hesitates to defend his brothers. He is named after the early Renaissance Italian artist and sculptor from Florence, Donatello. Raphael (Raph)--The team's bad boy, Raphael wears a red mask and wields a pair of sai. He has an aggressive nature, and seldom hesitates to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a very pronounced New York accent. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and oftentimes delivers deadpan humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothers and sensei. He is named after the Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance, Raphael. Splinter--The Turtles 'sensei and adoptive father, Splinter is a Japanese mutant rat that learned the ways of ninjutsu from his owner and master, Hamato Yoshi. In the 1987 TV series, Archie Comics series, and the 2012 TV series, Splinter was Hamato Yoshi mutated into a humanoid rat. In the 2003 TV series, he was Hamato Yoshi's pet rat. He was mutated from a mysterious ooze from the TCRI building. In the IDW comics, he is Hamato Yoshi reincarnated as a mutated rat. AprilO'Neil--A former lab assistant to the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, April is the plucky human companion of the Turtles. April first met the Turtles when they saved her from Baxter's Mouser robots. She embarks on many of the Turtles 'adventures and aids them by doing the work in public that the Turtles can not. In the 1987 TV series, Archie Comics series, the subsequent three films, and the 2014 film reboot, April was a television news reporter. In the 2007 CGI film (following the continuity from the original three films), Casey Jones and she work for a shipping firm. In the 2012 series, April is a teenager who is rescued by the TMNTs and later given some ``crash courses'' in being a ninja by Splinter. Casey Jones--A vigilante who wears a hockey mask to protect his identity, Casey Jones has become one of the Turtles 'closest allies, as well as a love interest to April. Casey first encountered the Turtles after having a fight with Raphael. He fights crime with an assortment of sporting goods he carries in a golf bag, such as baseball bats, golf clubs, and hockey sticks. The Shredder--A villainous ninjutsu master called Oroku Saki, he is the leader of the Foot Clan, an evil ninja clan. In every incarnation of the TMNT franchise, he has been the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter. The Shredder prefers to use his armor instead of weapons in some versions. Foot Soldiers/ Ninjas--The ninjas of the Foot Clan who work for the Shredder. They are probably the most common villains that the Turtles encounter. Karai--A female high-rank member of the Foot Clan, she has appeared in several different TMNT comics, cartoons, and films, as well as in multiple video games. In some incarnations of the character, she is closely related to Shredder as his adopted daughter or biological granddaughter. In most works, she shares an ambiguous rivalry with Leonardo, which occasionally even borders on romantic interest. Comics (edit) Mirage (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios) Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles premiered in May 1984, at a comic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was published by Mirage Studios in an oversized magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap newsprint, limited to a print run of only3,250 copies. Through a clever media kit that included a press release in The Comics Journal# 89 and a full-page ad placed in Comic Buyer's Guide# 547, the public's interest was piqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon. The small print runs made these early comics and trade magazines instant collector items, and within months, they were trading for over 50 times their cover price. The name ``Mirage Studios'' was chosen because of Eastman and Laird's lack of a professional art studio at the start of their career, before their creation made them both multimillionaires. Mirage also published a bimonthly companion book entitled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, featuring art by Ryan Brown and Jim Lawson, which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT universe. This put the original series and Tales in the same mainstream continuity, and the two are thus canon to each other. The title's first volume was from 1987--1989, released in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book. All seven issues of volume one have been collected in trade paperback form twice, and 25 issues of volume two have been collected in trades of five issues each. As the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media, Eastman and Laird found themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut. However, this prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book. So, many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The breadth of diversity found in the various short stories gave the series a disjointed, anthology-like feel. Fans stuck with the series, and what was originally intended as a one-shot became a continuing series that lasted for 129 issues, spanning four separate volumes (having 62, 13, 23, and 32 issues in the four distinct volumes). In June 1996, Image Comics took over publishing the title in what is considered ``volume 3'' of the series. It was a slightly more action-oriented TMNT series and although notable for inflicting major physical changes on the main characters, Peter Laird,co-creator of the TMNT, has said this volume is no longer in canon as he began publishing volume 4 at Mirage Publishing. As an explanation, he offered in the pages of the volume 4 (issue# 8) letter column: ``It just didn't feel right.'' After taking back the series from Image Comics, Mirage Studios resumed publication of a fourth volume in December 2001, under the simple title TMNT. After the publication of issue number 28, writer Peter Laird placed the series on an eight-month hiatus to devote himself to production of the 2007 TMNT movie. However, after that eight months had passed, Mirage's official website went on to list the series as in ``indefinite hiatus''. In January 2008, Mirage had finally confirmed that the series would return in May 2008. Issues 29 and 30 had a limited printing of1,000 copies each, and were available through the official TMNT website. Although the purchase agreement with Nickelodeon allows Laird to produce up to 18 comics a year set in the original Mirage continuity, no new material was released in the next few years. The latest issue of TMNT volume 4 was issue# 32 which came out in print May 4, 2014, and online on May 9, 2014, almost 4 years after issue# 31 was last released. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles adventures (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures was a comic-book series published from August 1988 to October 1995 by Archie Comics. The initial storylines were close adaptations of the 1987 TV series, but with the fifth issue, Eastman and Laird decided to hand the series over to Mirage Studios employees Ryan Brown and Stephen Murphy, who immediately abandoned the animated series adaptations and took the title in a decidedly different direction with all-new original adventures, including the uniting of several of the series 'recurring characters as a separate team, the Mighty Mutanimals. Dreamwave (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Dreamwave Productions) A monthly comic inspired by the 2003 TV series was published by Dreamwave Productions from June to December 2003. It was written by Peter David and illustrated by LeSean Thomas. In the first four issues, which were the only ones directly adapted from the TV series, the story was told from the perspectives of April, Baxter, Casey, and a pair of New York City police officers. IDW (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW Publishing) In April 2011, IDW Publishing announced that they had acquired the license to publish new collections of Mirage storylines and a new ongoing series. The first issue of the new series was released on August 24, 2011. Turtlesco-creator Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz write, with Eastman and Dan Duncan handling art chores. Manga (edit) The Turtles have appeared in several manga series. Mutant Turtles (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba, My\u016btanto T\u0101toruzu) is a 15-issue series by Tsutomu Oyamada, Zuki mora, and Yoshimi Hamada that simply adapted episodes of the original American animated series. Super Turtles (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba S\u016bp\u0101 T\u0101toruzu) is a three-issue miniseries by Hidemasa Idemitsu, Tetsur\u014d Kawade, and Toshio Kud\u014d that featured the ``TMNT Supermutants'' Turtle toys that were on sale at the time. The first volume of the anime miniseries followed this storyline. Mutant Turtles Gaiden (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba \u5916\u4f1d, My\u016btanto T\u0101toruzu Gaiden) by Hiroshi Kanno is a reinterpretation of the Turtles story with no connection to the previous manga. Mutant Turtles III (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba 3, My\u016btanto T\u0101toruzu Tsuri) is Yasuhiko Hachino's adaptation of the third feature film. Mutant Turtles '95 (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba 95, My\u016btanto T\u0101toruzu Ky\u016bj\u016bgo) is a 1995 series by Ogata Nobu which ran in Comic BomBom. Mutant Turtles '96 (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba 96, My\u016btanto T\u0101toruzu Ky\u016bj\u016broku) is a continuation of the 1995 series when it continued to run through 1996. Comic strip (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic strip) A daily comic strip written and illustrated by Dan Berger began in 1990. It featured an adventure story Monday through Friday and activity puzzles on weekends (with fan art appearing later). The comic strip was published in syndication until its cancellation in December 1996. At its highest point in popularity, it was published in over 250 newspapers. Television series (edit) First animated series (1987--1996) (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Logo of the 1987 cartoon When little-known Playmates Toys, Inc. was approached about producing a TMNTs action figure line, they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first. On December 28, 1987, the TMNT's first cartoon series began, starting as a five-part miniseries and becoming a regular Saturday-morning syndicated series on October 1, 1988, with 13 more episodes. The series was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Film Productions, Inc. (later Fred Wolf Films). Mirage Studios does not own the rights to this cartoon series. The show places a much stronger emphasis on humor than the comics do. Here, the Ninja Turtles are portrayed as four wise-cracking, pizza-obsessed superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout, and they make their first appearance in masks color-coded to each turtle, where previously they had all worn red. The cast included new and different characters, such as Bebop and Rocksteady and the Neutrinos. Original characters such as Splinter, Shredder, and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only. Instead of being Hamato Yoshi's mutated pet rat, Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself. The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts, allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying (this was a very important decision in terms of the show's child audience; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children, the show's target demographic). Krang, one of the series 'most memorable villains, was inspired by the design of the Utrom, a benign alien race from the Mirage comics. The animated Krang, however, was instead an evil warlord from Dimension X. Baxter Stockman, whose race was changed from black to white either due to apprehension toward depicting a villainous African American character in a children's cartoon or that for Shredder to boss around a black Stockman would be perceived as racist. Either way, Stockman was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder, later mutating into an anthropomorphic housefly. During the final two seasons of the show, to combat the rising popularity of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg, an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself. Starting on September 25, 1989, the series was expanded to weekdays and it had 47 more episodes for the new season. There were 28 new syndicated episodes for season 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990. The ``European Vacation'' episodes were not seen in the United States until USA Network started showing reruns in late 1993 and the ``Awesome Easter'' episodes were not seen until 1991. These episodes were delayed because of animation or scheduling problems. The turtles are also well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the surfer lingo of the time, especially by Michelangelo. Words and phrases included ``bummer'', ``dude'', ``bogus'', ``radical'', ``far-out'', ``tubuloso'', ``bodacious'', and possibly the most recognized, ``cowabunga''. On April 21, 1990, a drug-prevention television special was broadcast on ABC, NBC, and CBS named Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time; representing TMNT was Michelangelo, voiced by Townsend Coleman. Starting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show began its run on CBS. The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour until 1994, initially airing a few Saturday-exclusive episodes back-to-back. Also, a brief ``Turtle Tips'' segment aired between the two episodes, which served as public-service announcement about the environment or other issues. After 1994, the show was reduced to just a half-hour and only eight episodes per season were produced, grouped into a ``CBS Action Zone'' block that also featured WildC. A.T.s. and Skeleton Warriors, both of which were canceled after one season; though TMNTs retained their ``Action Zone'' introduction. The two shows in the block were also produced by Fred Wolf Films. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode. Its enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators, including the Battletoads, Cheetahmen, Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa, Road Rovers, Street Sharks, Extreme Dinosaurs, and Biker Mice from Mars. Currently, all 193 episodes are available on DVD and VHS. Original video animation (edit) Main article: Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen In addition to the American series, a Japan-exclusive two-episode anime original video animation (OVA) series was made in 1996, titled Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen. The OVA is similar in tone to the 1987 TV series and uses the same voices from TV Tokyo's Japanese dub of the 1987 TV series. The first episode was made to advertise the TMNT Supermutants toys. It featured the Turtles as superheroes, that gained costumes and superpowers with the use of Mutastones, while Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady gained supervillain powers with the use of a Dark Mutastone. As with the Super Sentai and Power Rangers franchises, the four Turtles could combine to form the giant Turtle Saint. The second episode was created to advertise the Metal Mutants toys in which the characters gain SaintSeiya-esque mystical metal armor that can transform into beasts. Live-action series (1997--1998) (edit) Logo of the live-action series Main article: Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation In 1997--1998, the Turtles starred in a live-action television series called Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation that directly follows the events of the first three movies. A fifth turtle was introduced, a female named Venus de Milo, who was skilled in the mystical arts of the shinobi. The series was intended as a loose continuation of the movie franchise, as Shredder had been defeated and the Ninja Turtles encountered new villains. Other connections to the feature films include the fact that Splinter's ear was cut, the Foot Soldiers were humans, and the Turtles lived in the abandoned subway station seen in the second and third movies. The Next Mutation Turtles made a guest appearance on Power Rangers in Space. It was canceled after one season of 26 episodes. Second animated series (2003--2009) (edit) Logo of the 2003 cartoon Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) In 2003, a new TMNT series produced by 4Kids Entertainment began airing on the ``FoxBox'' (later renamed ``4Kids TV'') programming block. It later moved to ``The CW4Kids'' block. The series wasco-produced by Mirage Studios, and Mirage owned one-third of the rights to the series. Mirage's significant stake in creative control resulted in a cartoon that hews more closely to the original comics, creating a darker and edgier feel than the 1987 cartoon, but still remains lighthearted enough to be considered appropriate for children. This series lasted until 2009, ending with a feature-length television movie titled Turtles Forever, which was produced in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the TMNTs franchise and featured the Turtles of the 2003 series teaming up with their counterparts from the 1987 series. 4Kidstv.com featured all the episodes of the series, until September 2010, when Nickelodeon brought the series and air the series occasionally on Nicktoons and Nickelodeon normally during TMNTs marathons. Third animated series (2012--2017) (edit) Logo of the 2012 cartoon Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) Nickelodeon acquired the global rights to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the Mirage Group and 4Kids Entertainment, Inc. and announced a new CGI-animated TMNT television series. The 2012 version is characterized by anime-like iconography and emphasis on mutagen continuing to wreak havoc on the everyday lives of the Turtles and their enemies. The series ran for five seasons. Fourth animated series (2018) (edit) Main article: Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Nickelodeon announced a new 2D animated series based on the franchise, which will debut in July 2018. Feature films (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film series) The Turtles have appeared in six feature films. The first three are live-action features produced in the early 1990s: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993). The Turtles were played by various actors in costumes featuring animatronic heads, initially produced by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The fourth film is a CGI-animated film titled simply TMNT and released in 2007. A reboot, titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies, and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman, and produced by Michael Bay, was released on August 8, 2014. A sequel, Out of the Shadows was released on June 3, 2016. Merchandise (edit) Among the first licensed products to feature the TMNT was a tabletop role-playing game titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles& Other Strangeness, published by Palladium Books in 1985, and featuring original comics and illustrations by Eastman and Laird. The game features a large list of animals, including elephants and sparrows, that are available as mutant player characters. Several more titles were in this genre, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, Truckin 'Turtles, Turtles Go Hollywood, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guide to the Universe, and Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures in Boise, Idaho, produced an attendant set of lead figurines; unlike later incarnations, the bandannas on the store's display set were painted all black before the multicolored versions were released to help younger readers distinguish between the four characters other than their weaponry. Palladium allowed the license to lapse in 2000, in part due to declining sales stemming from the ``kiddification'' of the animated and live-action incarnations to that point. However, Palladium's publisher, Kevin Siembieda, has indicated a potential willingness to revisit the license given the franchise's recent moves closer to its roots. Toys (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures During the run of the 1987 TV series, Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT action figures, along with vehicles, playsets, and accessories, becoming one of the top collectibles for children. Staff artists at Northampton, Massachusetts-based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging. In addition, Playmates produced a series of TMNTs/ Star Trek crossover figures, due to Playmates holding the Star Trek action-figure license at the time. Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the toy line, including Bloom Design, White Design, Pangea, Robinson-Clarke, and McHale Design. The marketing vice president of Playmates, Karl Aaronian, was largely responsible for assembling the talented team of designers and writers, which in turn, helped germinate continued interest in the toy line. Never before in toy history did an action-figure line have such an impact for over two decades, generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue. The series was highly popular in the UK, where in the run-up to Christmas, the Army& Navy Store in London's Lewisham devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle, including games, videos, costumes, and other items. Playmates continue to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series. The 2007 film TMNT also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures, while National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced a series of high-quality action figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics. In 2012, a new toy line and a new classic toy line from Playmates were announced to be released. Video games (edit) Main article: List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games The first console video game based on the franchise, titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Konami under their ``Ultra Games'' label in 1989 and later ported to home computers and eventually for the Wii on the Virtual Console. Also released by Konami in 1989 was an arcade game, also titled simply Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, later ported to the NES as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game, leading to an NES-only sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project, which used the look of the arcade game, as opposed to the first NES game. The next Turtles game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, was released in 1991 as an arcade game, and was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES) in 1992. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist was also created for the Sega Genesis in the same year, and used many of the art assets from TMNT IV. There was also a trilogy of TMNT video games for the original Game Boy system made by Konami, consisting of: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue. As the video game series progressed, and the Ninja Turtles 'popularity began to decline in themid-1990s, the video games changed direction. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters was released as a set of one-on-one fighting game similar to the Street Fighter series; versions were released for the NES, SNES, and Genesis, each a distinct game. Konami also acquired the license to adapt the 2003 TV series into a video game franchise, resulting in a new series of games with 3D gameplay inspired by the old TMNT beat 'em up games, consisting of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 video game), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee. In 2006, Ubisoft acquired the rights for TMNT games, beginning with a game based on the 2007 animated feature film, along with a distinct game for the Game Boy Advance similar in style to the Konami arcade games. A beat 'em up game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack was released for the Nintendo DS in 2009, to coincide with the series '25th anniversary. In 2013, Activision released the downloadable game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, based on the 2012 TV series and developed by Red Fly Studio for the Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and Steam. On January 25, 2016, Activision and PlatinumGames announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC. The game is described as a third-person, team-based brawler. The campaign will be playable either single-player orco-op and will have an original story written by Tom Waltz, IDW comic writer and editor. The art style is based on long time TMNT comic artist Mateus Santolouco. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Legends, a Free to play Role-playing video game has been released by Ludia in summer 2016 for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Kindle Fire. It is based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series). The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles appear as playable characters in the DC Comics fighting game Injustice 2 as a part of the ``Fighter Pack 3'' downloadable content. In other media (edit) Tabletop role playing game (edit) In 1985, Palladium Books published Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles& Other Strangeness. This was a stand-alone game, as well as acting as an expansion for their game Rifts. The game used many key mechanics from the Palladium system. The game itself is limited to which martial arts are available, but a separate book, Ninjas and Superspies, increased the amount available to a choice of 41 martial arts styles. Examples of animals created are included in the appendices as potential antagonists, including the Terror Bears, Caesers Weasels, and Sparrow Eagles, as well as including stats for the Turtles and other characters. Food tie-ins (edit) Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles food tie-ins During the height of their popularity, the Turtles had a number of food tie-ins. Among the most notable of these products was Ninja Turtles Cereal, produced by Ralston-Purina as a kind of ``Chex with TMNT-themed marshmallows'' which also came with a small pouch of Pizza Crunchabungas, pizza-flavored corn snacks in the shape of pizzas (the commercial starred the Ninja Turtles as Will Vinton-created claymations); Hostess Ninja Turtles Pudding Pies, featuring a green sugar crust and vanilla pudding inside; and Royal OOZE Gelatin Desserts, distributed by Nabisco under ``Royal Gelatin'' in three different flavors: orange, strawberry, and lime. Shreddies used to give out TMNT toys in their boxes when the cereal advertising was still geared toward children. One example of a TMNT prize was rings featuring a character on the cartoon (1992). There was also green Ninja Turtle ice cream with different toppings according to which turtle flavor one ordered. Chef Boyardee also released a canned pasta with the pasta in the shapes of the four turtles. Concert tour (edit) To capitalize on the Turtles 'popularity, a concert tour was held in 1990, premiering at Radio City Music Hall on August 17. The ``Coming Out of Their Shells'' tour featured live-action turtles playing music as a band (Donatello, keyboards; Leonardo, bass guitar; Raphael, drums and sax; Michelangelo, guitar) on stage around a familiar plotline: AprilO'Neil is kidnapped by the Shredder, and the Turtles have to rescue her. The story had a very Bill-n '-Ted-esque feel, with its theme of the power of rock n 'roll literally defeating the enemy, in the form of the Shredder (who only rapped about how he hates music) trying to eliminate all music. A pay-per-view special highlighting the concert was shown, and a studio album was also released. The track listing is as follows: show Concert tour track list ``Coming Out of Our Shells!'' ``Sing About It'' ``Tubin ''' ``Skipping Stones'' ``Pizza Power'' ``Walk Straight'' ``No Treaties'' ``Cowabunga'' ``April Ballad'' ``Count on Us'' Since the tour was sponsored by Pizza Hut in real life, many references are made to their pizza. Empty Pizza Hut boxes are seen onscreen in the ``Behind the Shells'' VHS. As part of across-marketing strategy, Pizza Hut restaurants gave away posters, audio cassettes of ``Coming Out of Their Shells'', and ``Official Tour Guides'' as premiums. The original show of the tour was released on video with a making of video also released. The song ``Pizza Power'' was later used by Konami for the second arcade game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time. At the Disney-MGM Studios theme park (edit) On June 30, 1990, the TMNT appeared in the ``New York Street'' section of Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando. Emerging from their Turtle Party Wagon, they would ``ninja dance'' across the stage while April performed the theme song to the show. After the main show was done, they posed for pictures and signed autographs. The Turtles also made appearances in Disney's Very Merry Christmas Parade to sing their own rendition of ``Santa Claus is Coming to Town''. They also appeared during the Easter parade dancing to their single ``Pizza Power!'' The Turtles 'live shows and appearances ceased production in 1996. Parodies (edit) Cover of Cracked# 255, August 1990 Although the TMNT had originated as something of a parody, the comic's explosive success led to a wave of small-press, black and white comic parodies of TMNT itself, including Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters,Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung-Fu Kangaroos, and a host of others. Dark Horse Comics 'Boris the Bear was launched in response to these TMNT clones; its first issue was titled ``Boris the Bear Slaughters the Teenage Radioactive Black Belt Mutant Ninja Critters''. Once the Turtles broke into the mainstream, parodies also proliferated in other media, such as in satire magazines Cracked and Mad and numerous TV series of the period. The satirical British television series Spitting Image featured a recurring sketch ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turds''. Controversies (edit) Departure from origins (edit) The Turtles engaged in a greater amount of overt violence in the pages of the early Mirage comic book series by Eastman and Laird. As the TMNT were introduced into the mainstream, they were radically redesigned. In issue# 19 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the creators published an editorial addressing any possible concerns of readers as a result of this. It stated, in part: ``We've allowed the wacky side to happen, and enjoy it very much. All the while, though, we've kept the originals very much ours--forty pages of what we enjoy and want to see in our books, whether it comes from our own hands or from those of the talented people we work with.'' In the film Turtles Forever, the original Mirage Turtles refer to their counterparts from the 1987 cartoon series and the 2003 cartoon series as ``sell-outs'', in reference to their colorful accessories (the originals are conveyed in black and white). Teenage Mutant ``Hero'' Turtles (edit) The title screen from the TMHT version, altered due to censorship. Upon TMNT's first arrival in the United Kingdom the name was changed to ``Teenage Mutant 'Hero 'Turtles'' (or TMHT, for short), since the British Broadcasting Corp deemed the word ninja to have excessively violent connotations for a children's program. Consequently, everything related to the Turtles (comic books, video games, toys, etc.) was renamed before being released in the UK as well as various other European countries. The lyrics were also changed, such as changing ``Splinter taught them to be ninja teens'' to ``Splinter taught them to be fighting teens''. The policies also had other effects, such as editing out use of Michelangelo's nunchaku (which were at the time banned by James Ferman, chairman of the BBFC, from appearing in films and generally toning down the usage of all the turtles 'weapons.) To head this problem off, the showrunners elected to remove Michelangelo's nunchaku entirely during season three, replacing them with a grappling hook called the ``Turtle Line'' that served as Mikey's signature weapon for the rest of the show's run. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, they kept Michelangelo's nunchaku but the ``TMHT'' logo could be seen in the intro, as it was not edited to reflect the title in each of those translations. In Spain the cartoon was originally aired in regional TV channels and thus had different dubs in addition to Castillian: Galician and Catalan; in the Galician version, the title As Tartarugas Mutantes (``The Mutant Turtles'') was used. The Italian and European Portuguese dubs also had few edits. However, when the live-action movie came out in 1990, the Ninja of the title was kept even in the UK. In time, nunchaku scenes were retained in previously-censored movies such as those of Bruce Lee. The same went for the PAL releases of the early video games, which had Michelangelo's weapon of choice fully visible and usable. By the time of the 2003 TV series, these censorship policies had been abolished, and no changes have occurred in the content of the show. The name ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' remained unchanged for the 2003 TV series. As a result, in the UK, the 1987 TV series is still called Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and the 2003 TV series is called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 2009, Lionsgate Home Entertainment released the 25th Anniversary Collectors Edition on Region 2 DVD in the UK. This 3-Disc set contains all the episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 and 4 episodes from the final season, as well as a 1-Disc DVD with the first few episodes of Season 1. This release features the original, unedited episodes under the ``Ninja Turtles'' title, and also marks the first time the show has been released and left uncensored in the UK. Ownership rights (edit) Due to various movie and television deals, the various TMNT films and television series have split between various companies, with Mirage Studios having retained copyright and trademark until October 19, 2009, at which point the rights for the entire TMNT franchise were sold byco-creator Peter Laird to Nickelodeon. Television (edit) The original animated series (1987--1996) was produced by Fred Wolf Films Dublin (as Murakami Wolf Swenson (MWS) and Murakami Wolf Dublin (MWD) during earlier seasons), and syndicated by Group W. The series itself is owned by Wolf Films, with home entertainment rights residing with Lions Gate Entertainment, and until recently, syndication rights belonged to Nickelodeon's former corporate sibling CBS Television Distribution. The initial five-part miniseries (retroactively considered the first season) was copyrighted by Playmates Toys, although their rights to those episodes were bought out by Fred Wolf Films. Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation was produced by Saban Entertainment, and as of September 2011, is owned and distributed by Saban Brands. The second animated series (2003--2009) was aco-production between Mirage Studios and 4Kids Entertainment. Nickelodeon's October 19, 2009 buyout of the TMNT franchise included an approximate$9.75 million payment to 4Kids to terminate its right to serve as the merchandise licensing agent prior to the scheduled expiration of the representation agreement in 2012. Due to the buyout, all future TMNT film and television series rights are owned by Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon also gained the rights to the 2003 series after terminating 4Kids 'contract. Films (edit) The first three TMNT live-action films were produced by Golden Harvest, with New Line Cinema (now a sister company of Warner Bros. Entertainment) distributing the films in the United States, with 20th Century Fox distributing the second and third films in most other territories. The first two films were copyrighted by the UK-based Northshore Investments. The third film was copyrighted by Clearwater Holdings. The fourth film was produced by Imagi Animation Studios, and released by Warner Bros. Entertainment in association with the Weinstein Company. Michael Bay produced a feature film directed by Jonathan Liebesman simply titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and was released on August 8, 2014. A sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, was released on June 3, 2016, with Megan Fox and Will Arnett reprising their roles and debuting Stephen Amell as Casey Jones. Dave Green replaced Liebesman as the director. Comic Books (edit) Initially, Mirage allowed employees and freelancers to retain the rights to characters they created for the TMNT Universe but had never licensed for media and merchandise outside comic books. Eventually, due to the difficulty of keeping track of everyone's rights, Mirage made TMNT character creators sign retroactive work-for-hire contracts. One creator who did not sign over the rights to his TMNT work was Swamp Thing veteran Rick Veitch.

The iPhone 5S is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. Part of the iPhone series, the device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. It was released on September 20, 2013, along with its lower-cost counterpart, the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the iPhone 5, although the 5S received a new white/ gold color scheme in addition to white/ silver and space gray/ black, however the 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware. The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 ``motionco-processor''. A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures. The iPhone 5S was the first Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock. The 5S is the third iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. The 5S supports IOS 7 up to version 11, being the oldest iPhone to support iOS 11 since it was the earliest to have incorporated a 64-bit SoC processor. Reception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5, and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013. The iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger iPhone 6 in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the iPhone SE, which incorporated internal hardware similar to the iPhone 6S while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.

Before its official unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a fingerprint scanner; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec, a developer of mobile security products, references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of iOS 7 and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic ``ring'' around it. Similar ring-based imagery was seen on the official invitation to Apple's iPhone press event in September 2013, where the new device was unveiled. Shortly before its official unveiling, The Wall Street Journal also reported the rumor. Apple announced the iPhone 5C and the iPhone 5S during a media event at its Cupertino headquarters on September 10, 2013. While the iPhone 5C became available for preorder on September 13, 2013, the iPhone 5S was not available for preorder. Both devices were released on September 20, 2013. While most of the promotion focused on Touch ID, the 64-bit Apple A7 processor was also a highlight during the event. This is the first-ever 64-bit processor in a phone of any kind. I don't think the other guys are even talking about it yet. Why go through all this? The benefits are huge. The A7 is up to twice as fast as the previous-generation system at CPU tasks, and up to twice as fast at graphics tasks, too.--Phil Schiller, Apple keynote at 4 Infinite Loop on September 10, 2013 Schiller then showed demos of Infinity Blade III to demonstrate the A7's processing power and the device's camera using untouched photographs. The release of iOS 7 on September 18, 2013 was also announced during the keynote. The iPhone 5S was released on September 20, 2013, in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, China, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It was released in 25 additional countries on October 25, 2013, and in 12 countries on November 1, 2013. Indonesia was the last country to receive the iPhone 5S, on January 26, 2014. On September 19, 2014, the iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but the older model remained available for purchase at a reduced price, while the 64GB version was discontinued. The gold edition of the iPhone 5S was discontinued on September 9, 2015, when Apple revealed the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus The iPhone 5S was discontinued on March 21, 2016, and succeeded by the iPhone SE, which continues the same form factor but features vastly upgraded internals similar to the flagship iPhone 6S. This was a break with Apple's product positioning trend (in North America and Western Europe), starting with iPhone 4S released in October 2011, which gave each newly released model one year as the flagship phone, then moving it to midrange for its second year of production, with the third and final year as the entry-level offering before discontinuation. While iPhone 5S was expected to continue on sale until September 2016, replacing it and its A7 processor early means that Apple ``just reduced its long-term chip support window by a year'' for iOS. In addition, a new iPhone launch was meant to stimulate demand, as sales of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus had not met expectations since their September 2015 release and the iPhone family may suffer its first ever negative growth quarter in 2016. Specifications (edit) Design (edit) Design and Hardware of iPhone 5S iPhone 5S's home button has a flat design and is made of scratch-resistant, laser-cut sapphire crystal surrounded by a stainless steel finger detection ring for using Touch ID. The camera has af/ 2.2 aperture and has dual ``True Tone'' flashes. The ``iPhone'' wordmark on the back of an iPhone 5S is now set in a thinner version of the Myriad typeface. The iPhone 5S maintains a similar design to the iPhone 5, with a 4 in (10 cm) LCDmulti-touch Retina display and a screen resolution of 640\u00d7 1136 at 326 ppi. Its home button has been updated with a new flat design using a laser-cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring; the button is no longer concave, nor does it contain the familiar squircle icon seen on previous models. The phone itself is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick and weighs 112 grams (4.0 oz). The phone uses an aluminum composite frame. The device is available in three color finishes; ``space-gray'' (replacing black with slate trim on the iPhone 5), white with silver trim, and white with gold trim. The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to be available in gold color; this decision was influenced by the fact that gold is seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers. Hardware (edit) The iPhone 5S is powered by the Apple A7 system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor ever used on a smartphone. The device's operating system andpre-loaded software were optimized to run in 64-bit mode, promising increased performance, although third-party app developers would need to optimize their apps to take advantage of these enhanced capabilities. The A7 processor is designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung. The A7 processor is accompanied by a new M7 ``motionco-processor'', a dedicated processor for processing motion data from the iPhone's accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor, which integrates with iOS 7's new CoreMotion APIs. The same A7 SoC and M7 motionco-processor are also found in the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 which were released in the same quarter as the iPhone 5S. The phone includes a 1560 mAh battery, which provides 10 hours of talk time and 250 hours of standby time. While the camera is still 8 megapixels in resolution with the image capture size of 3264\u00d7 2448 (4: 3), the lens has a larger aperture (f/ 2.2) and larger sized pixels in its image sensor than previous iPhone models. The flashlight has dual ``True Tone'' flashes, consisting of an amber LED and a white LED, which are variably used based on the color temperature of the photo to improve color balancing. The camera also includes automatic image stabilization, dynamic tone mapping, 10 fps burst mode, ``best shot'' mode and slow motion video at 120 fps. The home button on the iPhone 5S incorporates a fingerprint recognition system known as Touch ID, based on technology from AuthenTec, a company which Apple had acquired in 2012. The sensor uses a capacitive CMOS-based sensor which can detect the ``sub-epidermal layers'' of fingers at 500 pixels per inch, and uses a 360-degree design that can read the print at any angle. The sensor itself is activated by a touch-sensitive metallic ring surrounding the button. Touch ID can be used for various authentication activities within the operating system, such as unlocking the device or authenticating App Store and iTunes purchases instead of an Apple ID password. The sensor can be trained to recognize the fingerprints of multiple fingers and multiple users. Fingerprint data is stored in an encrypted format within a ``secure enclave'' of the A7 chip itself, and is not accessible to any other apps or servers (including iCloud). Camera (edit) You can capture photos at night as it comes with a double LED flash with rear camera. The iPhone 5S sports a new 8 megapixel iSight camera with the new camera app allowing fast continuous shooting and recording of slow-motion videos. Accessories (edit) Main article: iPhone accessories Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5S. According to technology commentators, the design of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely. Apple states that the design of their earphones allows it to ``rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more''. Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor. TechRadar further opined that the EarPods are inferior to other earphones of a similar price. Operating system and software (edit) Main articles: iOS, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10, and iOS 11 Further information: iOS version history The iPhone 5S is supplied with iOS 7, released on September 20, 2013. Jonathan Ive, the designer of iOS 7's new elements, described the update as ``bringing order to complexity'', highlighting features such as refined typography, new icons, translucency, layering, physics, and gyroscope-driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design. The design of both iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) noticeably departs from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of flat, colorful design. iOS 7 adds AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform. Users can share files with the iPhone 5 onwards, the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPad (4th generation) onwards, or iPad Mini (1st generation) onwards. The operating system also adds Control Center, a control panel accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Control Center contains a number of commonly used functions, such as volume and brightness controls, along with toggles for enabling Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode, and for using the rear camera's flash LED as a flashlight. iTunes Radio, an Internet radio service, is also included on the iPhone 5S. It is a free, ad-supported service available to all iTunes users, featuring Siri integration on iOS. Users are able to skip tracks, customise stations, and purchase the station's songs from iTunes Store. Users can also search through their history of previous songs. Apple accessories (edit) During the keynote, Apple announced a case for the iPhone 5 that is made of soft microfiber on the inside and leather on the outside. This case was announced along with iPhone 5C's case, both of which are the first cases Apple has announced since the iPhone 4 Bumpers. Docks for both the iPhone 5S and 5C were found on the Apple online store after the announcement. Because of the casing difference between the iPhone 5S and 5C, they have separate docks, each made specifically for each respective phone. Reception (edit) Critical reception (edit) The iPhone 5S received a mostly positive reception from reviewers and commentators. Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital gave the phone a favorable review, saying that Touch ID ``sounds like a gimmick, but it's a real advance, the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices,'' and labeled it ``the best smartphone on the market.'' David Pogue of The New York Times praised Touch ID, but said that the innovation of the smartphone market has been saturated, and ``maybe the age of annualmega-leaps is over.'' He focused much of his review on iOS 7, which he believed was the biggest change of the device over previous generations, praising new Siri features, Control Center, and AirDrop. In an editorial, Pogue stated that iOS 7 was the biggest change in the iPhone series, citing utilitarian interface changes as the main contributor to this. Scott Stein of CNET criticized the lack of design change over iPhone 5 and said that although the iPhone 5S ``is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date.'' Although praised for its camera, 64-bit A7 chip, M7 motion-chip, and fingerprint scanning capabilities, some investors thought that the iPhone 5S, although a notable improvement over the iPhone 5, was still relatively unchanged from its predecessor, and worried that the iPhone line had become a stagnant, dull product. Apple's share price fell 5.4% after the launch to close at a month low of$467.71 on the NASDAQ. Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch who praised the iPhone 5S as the best smartphone available said ``looks may not be different from the iPhone 5, but the internal components have a dramatic impact on day-to-day activities normal for a smartphone user,'' and went into detail explaining the impact of the improved camera and specifications on the phone. Etherington suggested that the 64-bit A7 processor will not reach its full potential until developers create applications supporting it. Myriam Joire of Engadget found that the iPhone 5S could benefit significantly from the A7 if developers created applications optimized for the 64-bit processor. Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech praised the phone's A7 processor, describing it as ``seriously impressive'', and stated that it was the most ``futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while-the iPhone 5S is as good a starting point as any.'' Scott Lowe of IGN also spoke highly of its 64-bit processor, ``which has a substantial lead in processing power over the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, accounting for a graphics boost of up to 32% and 38% in CPU benchmarks.'' The debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 processor took rival Android smartphone makers by surprise, particularly Qualcomm whose own 64-bit system-on-chip was not released until 2015. Most reviewers recommended the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released at the same time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/ features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9 GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/ glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish. As of 2015--16, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained thesecond-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/ 5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as ``long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general'' (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it ``felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick$650 bar of soap''. The iPhone 5 was described as ``elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time''. However, the iPhone 5/ 5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/ 6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/ 6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly. Commercial reception (edit) The iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales, with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C. After the first day of release, 1% of all iPhones in the US were iPhone 5Ss, while 0.3% were iPhone 5Cs. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray reported that the line at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store contained1,417 people on release day, compared to1,300 for the iPhone 4 in 2010, and 549 for the iPhone 3G in 2008 on their respective release days. This was the first time that Apple launched two models simultaneously. The first-day release in China also contributed to the record sales result. On launch day, major in-stock shortages were reported in most stores, across all countries where the iPhone 5S initially went on sale. A great many customers in line outside Apple Stores worldwide were left disappointed due to severe shortages across all 5S models, with the gold model in particular being in highly limited supply. While this situation eased in the US in the days following the launch, other countries reported receiving few restocks. Some commentators questioned how Apple handled the initial release, as onlinepre-orders were not offered for the iPhone 5S, meaning large numbers of people queuing outside physical stores, with most in line not receiving a unit. In the US, Apple offered an online reservation system, so customers could keep checking for units available at their local Apple Stores, and order for pickup. Online orders were also in short supply on launch day, with the shipping date across all model sizes and colors changing from ``7-10 working days'' to ``October'' in all countries, within hours of online orders being taken. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone onAT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile in September 2013 in the United States, outselling the iPhone 5C and Samsung Galaxy S4. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, the iPhone 5S outsold the 5C by a two-to-one margin during its September release, confirming Apple CEO Tim Cook's view that the high-end smartphone market was not reaching a point of market saturation. While commentators viewed the 5C as a flop because of supply chain cuts signifying a decline in demand, the 5S was viewed as a massive success. Apple admitted that it had failed to anticipate the sales ratio, leading to an overstocking of the 5C and shortages of the 5S. Six months after the release of the iPhone 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple announced that sales of the iPhone brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the iPhone 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the iPhone 5S from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, in the first quarter of their releases, had outsold the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 respectively. Impact of Touch ID (edit) See also: Touch ID\u00a7 Impact A number of technology writers, including Adrian Kingsley-Hughes of ZDNet and Kevin Roose of New York believed that the fingerprint scanning functionality of the iPhone 5S could help spur the adoption of the technology as an alternative to passwords by mainstream users (especially in ``bring your own device'' scenarios), as fingerprint-based authentication systems have only enjoyed wider usage in enterprise environments. However, citing research by biometrics engineer Geppy Parziale, Roose suggested that the CMOS-based sensor could become inaccurate and wear out over time unless Apple had designed the sensor to prevent this from occurring. Brent Kennedy, a researcher of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, recommended that users not immediately rely on the technology, citing the uncertainty over whether the system could properly reject a spoofed fingerprint. Following the release of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club announced on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using ``easy everyday means''. The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, ``We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.'' However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve. Problems (edit) Several problems were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported issue is that the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested that this is a hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.

                    "context": "List of Test cricket hat-tricks-wikipedia List of Test cricket hat-tricks Jump to: navigation, search English cricketer Stuart Broad took hat-tricks against India at Trent Bridge in 2011 and against Sri Lanka at Headingley in 2014. In the sport of cricket, a hat-trick is an occasion where a bowler takes three wickets in consecutive deliveries. As of 31 July 2017, this feat has only been achieved 43 times in more than two thousand Test matches, the form of the sport in which national representative teams compete in matches of up to five days 'duration. The first Test hat-trick was recorded on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match to take place, by the Australian pace bowler Fred Spofforth, nicknamed ``The Demon Bowler'', who dismissed three English batsmen with consecutive deliveries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The most recent bowler to achieve the feat was English spin bowler Moeen Ali against South Africa on 31 July 2017. At least one bowler from each of the ten nations that have played Test cricket have taken a Test hat-trick. A player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career. During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match. Australian Merv Hughes is the only bowler to take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. He took a wicket with the final ball of an over. With the first ball of the next over he took the final wicket of the West Indies innings. He then removed the opener Gordon Greenidge with the first ball of the West Indies second innings. In the five-match series between a Rest of the World XI and England in 1970, a hat-trick was taken by South African Eddie Barlow in the fourth match, at Headingley (the last three of four wickets in five balls). These matches were considered to be Tests at the time, but that status was later removed. Contents (hide) 1 Test hat-tricks 2 By team 3 See also 4 References 4.1 General 4.2 Specific Test hat-tricks (edit) Australian bowler Fred Spofforth took the first hat-trick in Test cricket on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match. Billy Bates was the first player to take a hat-trick for England, four years after Spofforth achieved the feat. Hugh Trumble is one of only four players to take more than one Test hat-trick, achieving the feat in 1902 and 1904. Courtney Walsh's hat-trick in 1988 was spread across two innings. In Australia's first innings he dismissed the last two batsmen with consecutive deliveries and then took a third wicket with the first ball of the second innings. Wasim Akram took two hat-tricks in the space of nine days in 1999. When Peter Siddle took a hat-trick for Australia in 2010, his final victim was Stuart Broad. Nine months later Broad himself would be the next man to take a Test match hat-trick.

After two plays, quarterback Jake Fromm attempted a pass downfield and was intercepted by Tony Brown. Alabama began their first drive of the game, and, after eleven plays, that drive ended with kicker Andy Pappanastos missing a 40-yard field goal. The teams each had three-and-outs for the game's first two punts. During Georgia's ensuing drive, the quarter ended, with no score. After a failed third down conversion, on the second play of the second quarter, Georgia kicker Rodrigo Blankenship hit a 41-yard field goal to open the scoring and put Georgia in the lead by three. Alabama's ensuing drive went nowhere, as they gained four yards on three plays and punted. Georgia took the ball and drove down the field, and found themselves with a first and goal at the Alabama 10-yard-line; the Tide defense held, however, and the Bulldogs settled for a second field goal and took a 6--0 lead with just over seven and a half minutes until half. On Alabama's next drive, the Georgia defense held yet again and Alabama's JK Scott punted for the third time. Just prior to the punt, Georgia wide receiver Javon Wims was shown walking to the locker room, reportedly with a left shoulder injury. Both defenses then forced punts, and Georgia took back over with 1: 19 remaining in the half on their own 31-yard-line. Nine plays later, on Alabama's 1-yard-line, Mecole Hardman took a direct snap, faked a handoff, and ran into the end zone for the game's first touchdown, putting Georgia up 13--0 going into halftime. Because they deferred the coin toss, Alabama received the ball first in the second half. They started their drive on their own 22-yard-line. Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama's backup quarterback, started the second half for the Tide; that drive quickly resulted in a three-and-out. The initial punt was blocked, but an offside call gave the Tide another chance to punt. Georgia started their drive on their own 36-yard-line, but punted on 4th& 17. Alabama took over on their own 44-yard-line. The teams then traded touchdowns on consecutive drives; Alabama scored their first points of the game on a 6-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Ruggs, but Georgia immediately responded with an 80-yard touchdown connection from Fromm to Mecole Hardman, putting Georgia up 20--7. On the second play of Alabama's ensuing drive, Tagovailoa, while scrambling to the left, threw into traffic and was intercepted by Georgia's Deandre Baker. Up 13, the Bulldogs took over possession of the ball on Alabama's 39-yard-line. The Tide defense responded immediately, however, as Raekwon Davis intercepted a Jake Fromm pass on the first play of Georgia's drive, returning the pick to the UGA 40-yard-line. The Tide gained fifteen yards on six plays and kicker Andy Pappanastos avenged his earlier miss with a 43-yard field goal that put Bama within ten. The teams then traded punts. Just prior to Alabama's punt, it was announced that an Alabama defensive back, Kyriq McDonald, had collapsed on the sideline; the situation was described as a ``serious medical emergency''. He was loaded onto a medical stretcher awake and conscious. Georgia could not muster anything on offense that drive, and punted. The fourth quarter saw Tagovailoa lead the Tide to come back and tie the game at 20 with 3: 49. With three seconds remaining in the game, Andy Pappanastos missed a potential game-winning 36-yard field goal to the left, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Georgia scored on a 51-yard field goal. On Alabama's first offensive play in overtime, Tagovailoa was sacked for a 16-yard loss, but immediately followed that with a game-winning 41-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith. Tagovailoa was named the offensive player of the game, andDa'Ron Payne was named the defensive player of the game.

On January 8, 2018, the network announced that its broadcast would feature a live performance by Kendrick Lamar during halftime. This performance was separate from the event proper at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (which featured a traditional halftime show with the marching bands of the participating teams), and originated from Centennial Olympic Park. Dispute (edit) Following an undefeated season in the American Athletic Conference and their victory over the Auburn Tigers in the 2018 Peach Bowl, the UCF Knights claimed the national championship by virtue of being the only undefeated team in the FBS level of college football. UCF held a victory parade at Disney World and hung a national championship banner at their stadium to celebrate this achievement. The school also paid national championship bonuses to all of its assistant coaches, many of whom left UCF after the Peach Bowl to follow head coach Scott Frost to his new head coaching job at Nebraska; Frost himself (who coached UCF in the game) did not receive such a bonus because he had already been paid all of the bonuses allowed by his UCF contract. The selection committee controversially ranked undefeated UCF 12th at the end of the regular season, below a number of two-loss teams from the Power Five conferences, which left them out of the CFP. The AP Poll ranked Alabama No. 1 in its final poll, receiving 57 first-place votes, while UCF was ranked No. 6 and received four first-place votes--the first time in the CFP era that the AP poll did not have a unanimous No. 1 team. Additionally, the Knights finished the 2017 football season as the No. 1 team in the Colley Bias Free Matrix Rankings. The Colley Matrix is recognized by the NCAA in its list of ``national champion major selections.''

The show, narrated by Future Ted, tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother. Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from ``Lucky Penny'' to ``The Time Travelers'' as an unseen character; she was first seen fully in ``Something New'' and was promoted to a main character in season 9. The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti. The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series, including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment. Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky's wedding; this scene is shown in ``Last Forever'', the series finale. The Mother's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024, also revealed in the series finale, received a mixed reaction from fans. An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD. In the alternate ending, Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. In the video, future Ted is heard saying, ``... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning, I can't help but be amazed how easy it all really was...'', indirectly stating that The Mother is alive. The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby. Contents (hide) 1 Casting 2 Character history 2.1 Name 3 Death 4 Notes 5 References Casting (edit) During its first eight seasons, the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother. Well-known actresses often made guest appearances on the show. Many fans expected that another would play one of the most-wanted roles in Hollywood, but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown. Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples, Thomas said that ``We didn't want it to be a big famous star because we didn't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be... The whole idea is that Ted's never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience'', similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had ``kept the show alive'' when it began. Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call. They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once; her musical ability was also helpful, as The Mother had been described as a band member. After competing for the role against at least two others, Milioti filmed her first scene--for the last episode of season 8--having never watched How I Met Your Mother; she recalled, ``I had ignorance on my side. So I didn't know what it meant.'' Milioti learned of the character's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer. Character history (edit) The Mother was born on September 19, 1984. The Mother, joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral service, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her--a ukulele. The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love. In ``Wait for It'', it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella. In ``No Tomorrow'', Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party which she also attended, as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max, her late boyfriend. She is still grieving, but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment. After they start talking, Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college. On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby, as seen in the season 4 finale ``The Leap'', he is seen in front of the classroom of students, one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother. But in the first episode of season 5, ``Definitions'', it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom--Economics instead of Architecture. At the same time in ``How Your Mother Met Me'', the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson), whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room, but when he announces the subject, The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off. She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom. Later, in ``Girls Versus Suits'', Ted dates Cindy, not knowing that her roommate is his future wife. Throughout the episode, Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate. When in Cindy and the mother's apartment he picks up many of The Mother's belongings, attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are (thinking the items are Cindy's) and glimpses the mother's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower. Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band. Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions, ``this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back.'' In ``How Your Mother Met Me'', it is revealed that, after Ted left the apartment, the Mother had discovered the umbrella and, upon going to question Cindy, finds her in a state. As she tried to console her, Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted, and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive, before spontaneously kissing her, revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush. While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian, it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating, as the kiss was her first in a long time. Some time after this, a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics. Darren gradually takes over the band. In the season 6 opener ``Big Days'' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife ``the day of'' the wedding at which he is the best man. In the episode ``False Positive'' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man, should she ever get married. In the episode ``Challenge Accepted'', it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney's wedding. In the last episode of season 7, ``The Magician's Code'' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin, and Ted will meet the mother ``the day of'' their wedding. On the premiere of season 8, Ted's wife appears after Barney and Robin's wedding, outside at the ``Farhampton'' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar. In the season 8 episode ``Band or DJ?,'' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute. The end result of the encounter is that Cindy's (now ex-) roommate's band plays at Barney and Robin's wedding. The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in ``How Your Mother Met Me'' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now-lead band member Darren talks to his fans. Later at MacLaren's Pub, she tells him she's not yet ready to date. Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after. The Mother meets all of Ted's best friends (Barney, Lily, Marshall and Robin) before she meets him. The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin, as revealed through a flashback in ``Platonish''. In ``The Locket'', Tracy meets Lily on a train journey. In ``Bass Player Wanted'', the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall, carrying his son Marvin, on her way to Farhampton Inn. On their way, it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band, that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception. But the band's leader, Darren, forced her to quit. The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band. She ends up alone at the bar, and while practicing a speech to give Darren, Darren walks up to her furious the groom's best man punched him for ``no reason.'' Amused by this, the Mother laughs, and Darren quits the band in anger. In ``How Your Mother Met Me'', it is shown that after this incident, the Mother returns to Louis 'summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend. As she walks in the door, Louis proposes to her, but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes. She declines Louis 'proposal and leaves his cottage, going to check in at Farhampton Inn. On her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings ``La Vie en Rose''. Ted hears her singing from his room next door. In ``Gary Blauman'', Ted and the Mother are on their first date. Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish-Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner. On the way there, Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run-in with Louis. She says that she is in the ``weirdest place on earth'' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating. Ted walks her back to her apartment. They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away. The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her. When the story is over, they say goodnight again. The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time, before deciding to carry on their date. In a flashforward in ``The Lighthouse'', Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn. She immediately accepts. In another flashfoward in ``Unpause'', the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child, Luke, in the year 2017. She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton. Name (edit) The Mother's real name is not revealed until the series finale, ``Last Forever''. When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station, she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell. In the season 1 episode ``Belly Full of Turkey'', Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says ``... that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother''. The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking, which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother's name is Tracy. Death (edit) See also: Last Forever In the series finale, it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children, Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness. In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead. Ted says that she ``became sick'' and his children saying that she has been ``gone'' for six years. Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother's death. Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die, but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning. Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was ``an amazing character'' and that ``over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy. Kuchman said that ``asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request'', that the finale ``advanced too quickly'' and that ``HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue''. A petition was started, aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale. The petition has over20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage. On April 5, 2014, Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD. No new material was shot for this scene. In the alternate ending, the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030. Notes (edit) Jump up^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that ``Pilot'' is set.

He is known for his roles as Rubeus Hagrid in the Harry Potter films, as Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky in the James Bond films GoldenEye and The World Is Not Enough, and as Dr. Eddie ``Fitz'' Fitzgerald in the British TV series Cracker during the 1990s. Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Personal life 4 Filmography and awards 4.1 Film 4.2 Television 4.3 Other awards 5 References 6 Bibliography 7 External links Early life and Education (edit) Coltrane was born Anthony Robert McMillan in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the son of Jean Ross (n\u00e9e Howie), a teacher and pianist, and Ian Baxter McMillan, a general practitioner who also served as a forensic police surgeon. He has an older sister, Annie, and a younger sister, Jane. Coltrane is the great-grandson of Scottish businessman Thomas W. Howie and the nephew of businessman Forbes Howie. He was educated at Glenalmond College, an independent school in Perthshire. Though he later described his experiences there as deeply unhappy, he played for the rugby First XV, was head of the school's debating society and won prizes for his art. From Glenalmond, Coltrane went on to Glasgow School of Art, where he was ridiculed for ``having an accent like Prince Charles'' (of which he quickly disposed, though not before gaining the nickname ``Lord Fauntleroy''), and thereafter the Moray House College of Education (part of the University of Edinburgh) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Coltrane later called for private schools to be banned and used to be known as ``Red Robbie'', rebelling against his conservative upbringing through involvement with Amnesty International, Greenpeace, the Labour Party and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Career (edit) Coltrane in costume in the 1980s Coltrane moved into acting in his early twenties, taking the stage name Coltrane (in tribute to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane) and working in theatre and comedy. Appearing in the 1981 BBC television comedy series A Kick Up the Eighties, his comic skills also brought him roles in The Comic Strip Presents (1982) series and the comedy sketch shows Alfresco (1983--1984) and Laugh??? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee (1984). Coltrane moved into roles in films such as Flash Gordon (1980), Death Watch (1980), Balham, Gateway to the South (1981), Scrubbers (1983), Krull (1983), The Supergrass (1985), Defence of the Realm (1985), Absolute Beginners (1986), Mona Lisa (1986) and appeared as ``Annabelle'' in The Fruit Machine (1988). On television, he appeared in The Young Ones, Tutti Frutti (1987), as Samuel Johnson in Blackadder (1987) (a role he later reprised in the more serious Boswell and Johnson's Tour of the Western Islands (1993)), and in a number of stand-up and sketch comedy shows. He played the part of Falstaff in Kenneth Branagh's Henry V (1989) Heco-starred with Eric Idle in Nuns on the Run (1990), and played the Pope in The Pope Must Die (1991). He also played a would-be private detective obsessed with Humphrey Bogart in the TV play The Bogie Man. His roles continued in the 1990s with the TV series Cracker (1993--1996, returning in 2006 for a one-off special), in which he starred as forensic psychologist Dr. Edward ``Fitz'' Fitzgerald. The role won him three BAFTA awards. Roles in bigger films followed; the James Bond films GoldenEye (1995) and The World Is Not Enough (1999), a supporting role in From Hell (2001), as well as half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the Harry Potter films (2001--2011). J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, had Coltrane at the top of her list to play Hagrid and, when asked whom she would like to see in the role, responded ``Robbie Coltrane for Hagrid'' in one quick breath. There is also an unnamed 8ft actor who stands in for the 6ft 1in Coltrane in some scenes. Coltrane has also presented a number of documentary programmes for the British ITV network based around his twin passions for travel and transportation. Coltrane in a Cadillac (1993) saw him cross North America from Los Angeles to New York behind the wheel of a 1951 Cadillac Series 62 coupe convertible, a journey of3,765 miles (6,059 km) which he completed in 32 days. In 1997, Coltrane appeared in a series of six programmes under the title Coltrane's Planes and Automobiles, in which he extolled the virtues of the steam engine, the diesel engine, the supercharger, the V8 engine, the two-stroke engine, and the jet engine. In these programmes he dismantled and rebuilt several engines. He also single-handedly removed the engine from a Trabant car in 23 minutes. In August 2007, Coltrane presented a series for ITV called B-Road Britain, in which he travelled from London to Glasgow, stopping in towns and villages along the way. Coltrane was voted No. 11 in ITV's TV's 50 Greatest Stars and sixth in a poll of 2000 adults across the UK to find the 'most famous Scot ', behind the Loch Ness Monster, Robert Burns, Sean Connery, Robert the Bruce and William Wallace. Robbie has hosted a true crime series called Critical Evidence since 2016. Personal life (edit) Coltrane married Rhona Gemmell on 11 December 1999. The couple have two children: son Spencer (b. 1992), and daughter Alice (b. 1998). Coltrane and Gemmell separated in 2003 and later divorced.

Bush on October 26, 2001 Major amendments USA Freedom Act The USA PATRIOT Act is an Act of Congress signed into law by US President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. With its ten-letter abbreviation (USA PATRIOT) expanded, the Act's full title is ``Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001''. The abbreviation, as well as the full title, have been attributed to Chris Cylke, a former staffer on the House Judiciary Committee. In response to the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks, Congress swiftly passed legislation to strengthen national security. On October 23, 2001, Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner introduced H.R. 3162 incorporating provisions from a previously-sponsored House bill and a Senate bill also introduced earlier in the month. The next day, the Act passed the House by a vote of 357--66, with Democrats comprising the overwhelming portion of dissent. The three Republicans voting ``no'' were Robert Ney of Ohio, Butch Otter of Idaho, and Ron Paul of Texas. On October 25, the Act passed the Senate by a 98--1 vote, the only dissident being Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. Those opposing the law have criticized its authorization of indefinite detentions of immigrants; the permission given law enforcement officers to search a home or business without the owner's or the occupant's consent or knowledge; the expanded use of National Security Letters, which allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to search telephone,e-mail, and financial records without a court order; and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to business records, including library and financial records. Since its passage, several legal challenges have been brought against the act, and federal courts have ruled that a number of provisions are unconstitutional. Many of the act's provisions were to sunset beginning December 31, 2005, approximately four years after its passage. In the months preceding the sunset date, anybody supporting the act pushed to make its sun-setting provisions permanent, while critics sought to revise various sections to enhance civil liberty protections. In July 2005, the U.S. Senate passed a reauthorization bill with substantial changes to several of the act's sections, while the House reauthorization bill kept most of the act's original language. The two bills were then reconciled in a conference committee criticized by Senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties for ignoring civil liberty concerns. The bill, which removed most of the changes from the Senate version, passed Congress on March 2, 2006, and was signed by President Bush on March 9 and 10 of that year. On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records, and conducting surveillance of ``lone wolves''--individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups. Following a lack of Congressional approval, parts of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015. With passing the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015, the expired parts were restored and renewed through 2019. However, Section 215 of the law was amended to stop the National Security Agency (NSA) from continuing its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with permission from a federal court.

Bush in October 2001, elucidating on the government's rationale behind the USA PATRIOT Act before signing into law. Title I: enhancing domestic Security against terrorism (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title I Title I authorizes measures to enhance the ability of domestic security services to prevent terrorism. The title established a fund forcounter-terrorist activities and increased funding for the Terrorist Screening Center which is administered by the FBI. The military was authorized to provide assistance in some situations that involve weapons of mass destruction when so requested by the Attorney General. The National Electronic Crime Task Force was expanded, along with the President's authority and abilities in cases of terrorism. The title also condemned the discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans that happened soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The impetus for many of the provisions came from earlier bills, for instance the condemnation of discrimination was originally proposed by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) in an amendment to the Combatting Terrorism Act of 2001, though in a different form. It originally included ``the prayer of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington in a Mass on September 12, 2001 for our Nation and the victims in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist hijackings and attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania reminds all Americans that 'We must seek the guilty and not strike out against the innocent or we become like them who are without moral guidance or proper direction. ''' Further condemnation of racial vilification and violence is also spelled out in Title X, where there was condemnation of such activities against Sikh Americans, who were mistaken for Muslims after the September 11th terrorist attack. Title II: surveillance procedures (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title II Title II is titled ``Enhanced Surveillance Procedures'', and covers all aspects of the surveillance of suspected terrorists, those suspected of engaging in computer fraud or abuse, and agents of a foreign power who are engaged in clandestine activities. It primarily made amendments to FISA, and the ECPA, and many of the most controversial aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act reside in this title. In particular, the title allows government agencies to gather ``foreign intelligence information'' from both U.S. andnon-U.S. citizens, and changed FISA to make gaining foreign intelligence information the significant purpose of FISA-based surveillance, where previously it had been the primary purpose. The change in definition was meant to remove a legal ``wall'' between criminal investigations and surveillance for the purposes of gathering foreign intelligence, which hampered investigations when criminal and foreign surveillance overlapped. However, that this wall even existed was found by the Federal Surveillance Court of Review to have actually been a long-held misinterpretation by government agencies. Also removed was the statutory requirement that the government prove a surveillance target under FISA is anon-U.S. citizen and agent of a foreign power, though it did require that any investigations must not be undertaken on citizens who are carrying out activities protected by the First Amendment. The title also expanded the duration of FISA physical search and surveillance orders, and gave authorities the ability to share information gathered before a federal grand jury with other agencies. The scope and availability of wiretapping and surveillance orders were expanded under Title II. Wiretaps were expanded to include addressing and routing information to allow surveillance of packet switched networks--the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) objected to this, arguing that it does not take into account email or web addresses, which often contain content in the address information. The Act allowed any district court judge in the United States to issue such surveillance orders and search warrants for terrorism investigations. Search warrants were also expanded, with the Act amending Title III of the Stored Communications Access Act to allow the FBI to gain access to stored voicemail through a search warrant, rather than through the more stringent wiretap laws. Various provisions allowed for the disclosure of electronic communications to law enforcement agencies. Those who operate or own a ``protected computer'' can give permission for authorities to intercept communications carried out on the machine, thus bypassing the requirements of the Wiretap statute. The definition of a ``protected computer'' is defined in 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1030 (e) (2) and broadly encompasses those computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including ones located outside the United States. The law governing obligatory and voluntary disclosure of customer communications by cable companies was altered to allow agencies to demand such communications under U.S.C. Title 18 provisions relating to the disclosure of electronic communications (chapter 119), pen registers and trap and trace devices (chapter 206) and stored communications (121), though it excluded the disclosure of cable subscriber viewing habits. Subpoenas issued to Internet Service Providers were expanded to include not only ``the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other subscriber number or identity, and length of service of a subscriber'' but also session times and durations, types of services used, communication device address information (e.g. IP addresses), payment method and bank account and credit card numbers. Communication providers are also allowed to disclose customer records or communications if they suspect there is a danger to ``life and limb''. Title II established three very controversial provisions: ``sneak and peek'' warrants, roving wiretaps and the ability of the FBI to gain access to documents that reveal the patterns of U.S. citizens. The so-called ``sneak and peek'' law allowed for delayed notification of the execution of search warrants. The period before which the FBI must notify the recipients of the order was unspecified in the Act--the FBI field manual says that it is a ``flexible standard''--and it may be extended at the court's discretion. These sneak and peek provisions were struck down by judge Ann Aiken on September 26, 2007, after a Portland attorney, Brandon Mayfield, was wrongly jailed because of the searches. The court found the searches to violate the provision that prohibits unreasonable searches in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Roving wiretaps are wiretap orders that do not need to specify all common carriers and third parties in a surveillance court order. These are seen as important by the Department of Justice because they believe that terrorists can exploit wiretap orders by rapidly changing locations and communication devices such as cell phones, while opponents see it as violating the particularity clause of the Fourth Amendment. Another highly controversial provision is one that allows the FBI to make an order ``requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, provided that such investigation of a United States person is not conducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.'' Though it was not targeted directly at libraries, the American Library Association (ALA), in particular, opposed this provision. In a resolution passed on June 29, 2005, they stated that ``Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to secretly request and obtain library records for large numbers of individuals without any reason to believe they are involved in illegal activity.'' However, the ALA's stance did not go without criticism. One prominent critic of the ALA's stance was the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, who argued in an article for the New York City Journal that ``(t) he furor over section 215 is a case study in Patriot Act fear-mongering.'' The title also covers a number of other miscellaneous provisions, including the expansion of the number of FISC judges from seven to eleven (three of which must reside within 20 miles (32 km) of the District of Columbia), trade Sanctions against North Korea and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and the employment of translators by the FBI. At the insistence of Republican Representative Richard Armey, the Act had a number of sunset provisions built in, which were originally set to expire on December 31, 2005. The sunset provision of the Act also took into account any ongoing foreign intelligence investigations and allowed them to continue once the sections had expired. The provisions that were to expire are below. Title III:anti-money-laundering to prevent terrorism (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title III Title III of the Act, titled ``International Money Laundering Abatement and FinancialAnti-Terrorism Act of 2001,'' is intended to facilitate the prevention, detection and prosecution of international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It primarily amends portions of the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (MLCA) and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). It was divided into three subtitles, with the first dealing primarily with strengthening banking rules against money laundering, especially on the international stage. The second attempts to improve communication between law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as expanding recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The third subtitle deals with currency smuggling and counterfeiting, including quadrupling the maximum penalty for counterfeiting foreign currency. The first subtitle tightened the recordkeeping requirements for financial institutions, making them record the aggregate amounts of transactions processed from areas of the world where money laundering is a concern to the U.S. government. It also made institutions put into place reasonable steps to identify beneficial owners of bank accounts and those who are authorized to use or route funds through payable-through accounts. The U.S. Treasury was charged with formulating regulations intended to foster information sharing between financial institutions to prevent money-laundering. Along with expanding record keeping requirements, it put new regulations into place to make it easier for authorities to identify money laundering activities and to make it harder for money launderers to mask their identities. If money laundering was uncovered, the subtitle legislated for the forfeiture of assets of those suspected of doing the money laundering. In an effort to encourage institutions to take steps that would reduce money laundering, the Treasury was given authority to block mergers of bank holding companies and banks with other banks and bank holding companies that had a bad history of preventing money laundering. Similarly, mergers between insured depository institutions andnon-insured depository institutions that have a bad track record in combating money-laundering could be blocked. Restrictions were placed on accounts and foreign banks. It prohibited shell banks that are not an affiliate of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or that are not subject to supervision by a banking authority in anon-U.S. country. It also prohibits or restricts the use of certain accounts held at financial institutions. Financial institutions must now undertake steps to identify the owners of any privately owned bank outside the U.S. who have a correspondent account with them, along with the interests of each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make sure they are not engaging in money laundering. Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. bynon-U.S. citizens. There is also an expectation that they must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any senior political figure where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption. Any deposits made from within the U.S. into foreign banks are now deemed to have been deposited into any interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S. Thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank. Restrictions were placed on the use of internal bank concentration accounts because such accounts do not provide an effective audit trail for transactions, and this may be used to facilitate money laundering. Financial institutions are prohibited from allowing clients to specifically direct them to move funds into, out of, or through a concentration account, and they are also prohibited from informing their clients about the existence of such accounts. Financial institutions are not allowed to provide any information to clients that may identify such internal accounts. Financial institutions are required to document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account thatco-mingles funds belonging to one or more customers. The definition of money laundering was expanded to include making a financial transaction in the U.S. in order to commit a violent crime; the bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds; the smuggling or illegal export of controlled munition and the importation or bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorized by the U.S. Attorney General and the smuggling of any item controlled under the Export Administration Regulations. It also includes any offense where the U.S. would be obligated under a mutual treaty with a foreign nation to extradite a person, or where the U.S. would need to submit a case against a person for prosecution because of the treaty; the import of falsely classified goods; computer crime; and any felony violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. It also allows the forfeiture of any property within the jurisdiction of the United States that was gained as the result of an offense against a foreign nation that involves the manufacture, importation, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance. Foreign nations may now seek to have a forfeiture or judgment notification enforced by a district court of the United States. This is done through new legislation that specifies how the U.S. government may apply for a restraining order to preserve the availability of property which is subject to a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgement. In taking into consideration such an application, emphasis is placed on the ability of a foreign court to follow due process. The Act also requires the Secretary of Treasury to take all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments make it a requirement to include the name of the originator in wire transfer instructions sent to the United States and other countries, with the information to remain with the transfer from its origination until the point of disbursement. The Secretary was also ordered to encourage international cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups. The Act also introduced criminal penalties for corrupt officialdom. An official or employee of the government who acts corruptly--as well as the person who induces the corrupt act--in the carrying out of their official duties will be fined by an amount that is not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. Penalties apply to financial institutions who do not comply with an order to terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days of being so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury. The financial institution can be fined$ US10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired. The second annotation made a number of modifications to the BSA in an attempt to make it harder for money launderers to operate and easier for law enforcement and regulatory agencies to police money laundering operations. One amendment made to the BSA was to allow the designated officer or agency who receives suspicious activity reports to notify U.S. intelligence agencies. A number of amendments were made to address issues related to record keeping and financial reporting. One measure was a new requirement that anyone who does business file a report for any coin and foreign currency receipts that are over US$10,000 and made it illegal to structure transactions in a manner that evades the BSA's reporting requirements. To make it easier for authorities to regulate and investigateanti-money laundering operations Money Services Businesses (MSBs)--those who operate informal value transfer systems outside of the mainstream financial system--were included in the definition of a financial institution. The BSA was amended to make it mandatory to report suspicious transactions and an attempt was made to make such reporting easier for financial institutions. FinCEN was made a bureau of the United States Department of Treasury and the creation of a secure network to be used by financial institutions to report suspicious transactions and to provide alerts of relevant suspicious activities was ordered. Along with these reporting requirements, a considerable number of provisions relate to the prevention and prosecution of money-laundering. Financial institutions were ordered to establishanti-money laundering programs and the BSA was amended to better defineanti-money laundering strategy. Also increased were civil and criminal penalties for money laundering and the introduction of penalties for violations of geographic targeting orders and certain record-keeping requirements. A number of other amendments to the BSA were made through subtitle B, including granting the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System power to authorize personnel to act as law enforcement officers to protect the premises, grounds, property and personnel of any U.S. National reserve bank and allowing the Board to delegate this authority to U.S. Federal reserve bank. Another measure instructed United States Executive Directors of international financial institutions to use their voice and vote to support any country that has taken action to support the U.S.'s War on Terrorism. Executive Directors are now required to provide ongoing auditing of disbursements made from their institutions to ensure that no funds are paid to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. The third subtitle deals with currency crimes. Largely because of the effectiveness of the BSA, money launders had been avoiding traditional financial institutions to launder money and were using cash-based businesses to avoid them. A new effort was made to stop the laundering of money through bulk currency movements, mainly focusing on the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the increase in penalties for money laundering. Congress found that a criminal offense of merely evading the reporting of money transfers was insufficient and decided that it would be better if the smuggling of the bulk currency itself was the offense. Therefore, the BSA was amended to make it a criminal offense to evade currency reporting by concealing more than US$10,000 on any person or through any luggage, merchandise or other container that moves into or out of the U.S. The penalty for such an offense is up to 5 years imprisonment and the forfeiture of any property up to the amount that was being smuggled. It also made the civil and criminal penalty violations of currency reporting cases be the forfeiture of all a defendant's property that was involved in the offense, and any property traceable to the defendant. The Act prohibits and penalizes those who run unlicensed money transmitting businesses. In 2005, this provision of the USA PATRIOT Act was used to prosecute Yehuda Abraham for helping to arrange money transfers for British arms dealer Hermant Lakhani, who was arrested in August 2003 after being caught in a government sting. Lakhani had tried to sell a missile to an FBI agent posing as a Somali militant. The definition of counterfeiting was expanded to encompass analog, digital or electronic image reproductions, and it was made an offense to own such a reproduction device. Penalties were increased to 20 years imprisonment. Money laundering ``unlawful activities'' was expanded to include the provision of material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations. The Act specifies that anyone who commits or conspires to undertake a fraudulent activity outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and which would be an offense in the U.S., will be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1029, which deals with fraud and related activity in connection with access devices. Title IV: border Security (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title IV Title IV amends the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to give more law enforcement and investigative power to the United States Attorney General and to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Attorney General was authorized to waive any cap on the number of full-time employees (FTEs) assigned to the INS on the Northern border of the United States. Enough funds were set aside to triple the maximum number of Border Patrol personnel, Customs Service personnel and INS inspectors along with an additional US$50,000,000 funding for the INS and the U.S. Customs Service to improve technology for monitoring the Northern Border and acquiring additional equipment at the Canadian northern border. The INS was also given the authority to authorize overtime payments of up to an extra US$30,000 a year to INS employees. Access was given to the Department of State and the INS to criminal background information contained in the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons File and any other files maintained by the National Crime Information Center to determine whether visa applicants and applicants could be admitted to the U.S. The Department of State was required to form final regulations governing the procedures for taking fingerprints and the conditions with which the department was allowed to use this information. Additionally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was ordered to develop a technology standard to verify the identity of persons applying for a United States visa. The reason was to make the standard the technology basis for across-agency, thecross-platform electronic system used for conducting background checks, confirming identities and ensuring that people have not received visas under different names. This report was released on November 13, 2002, however, according to NIST, this was later ``determined that the fingerprint system used was not as accurate as current state-of-the-art fingerprint systems and is approximately equivalent to commercial fingerprint systems available in 1998.'' This report was later superseded by section 303 (a) of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. Under Subtitle C, various definitions relating to terrorism were altered and expanded. The INA was retroactively amended to disallow aliens who are part of or representatives of a foreign organization or any group who endorses acts of terrorism from entering the U.S. This restriction also included the family of such aliens. The definition of ``terrorist activity'' was strengthened to include actions involving the use of any dangerous device (and not just explosives and firearms). To ``engage in terrorist activity'' is defined as committing, inciting to commit or planning and preparing to undertake an act of terrorism. Included in this definition is the gathering of intelligence information on potential terrorist targets, the solicitation of funds for a terrorist organization or the solicitation of others to undertake acts of terrorism. Those who provide knowing assistance to a person who is planning to perform such activities are defined as undertaking terrorist activities. Such assistance includes affording material support, including a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training to perform the terrorist act. The INA criteria for making a decision to designate an organization as a terrorist organization was amended to include the definition of a terrorist act. Though the amendments to these definitions are retroactive, it does not mean that it can be applied to members who joined an organization, but since left, before it was designated to be a terrorist organization under 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1189 by the Secretary of State. The Act amended the INA to add new provisions enforcing mandatory detention laws. These apply to any alien who is engaged in terrorism, or who is engaged in an activity that endangers U.S. national security. It also applies to those who are inadmissible or who must be deported because it is certified they are attempting to enter to undertake illegal espionage; are exporting goods, technology, or sensitive information illegally; or are attempting to control or overthrow the government; or have, or will have, engaged in terrorist activities. The Attorney General or the Attorney General's deputy may maintain custody of such aliens until they are removed from the U.S. unless it is no longer deemed they should be removed, in which case they are released. The alien can be detained for up to 90 days but can be held up to six months after it is deemed that they are a national security threat. However, the alien must be charged with a crime or removal proceedings start no longer than seven days after the alien's detention, otherwise the alien will be released. However, such detentions must be reviewed every six months by the Attorney General, who can then decide to revoke it, unless prevented from doing so by law. Every six months the alien may apply, in writing, for the certification to be reconsidered. Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this section, including judicial review of the merits of a certification, can be held under habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings can be initiated by an application filed with the United States Supreme Court, by any justice of the Supreme Court, by any circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or by any district court otherwise having jurisdiction to entertain the application. The final order is subject to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Provisions were also made for a report to be required every six months of such decisions from the U.S. Attorney General to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate. A sense of Congress was given that the U.S. Secretary of State should expedite the full implementation of the integrated entry and exit data system for airports, seaports, and land border ports of entry specified in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). They also found that the U.S. Attorney General should immediately start the Integrated Entry and Exit Data System Task Force specified in section 3 of the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. Congress wanted the primary focus of development of the entry-exit data system was to be on the utilization of biometric technology and the development of tamper-resistant documents readable at ports of entry. They also wanted the system to be able to interface with existing law enforcement databases. The Attorney General was ordered to implement and expand the foreign student monitoring program that was established under section 641 (a) of the IIRIRA. which records the date and port of entry of each foreign student. The program was expanded to include other approved educational institutions, including air flight schools, language training schools or vocational schools that are approved by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of State. US$36,800,000 was appropriated for the Department of Justice to spend on implementing the program. The Secretary of State was ordered to audit and report back to Congress on the Visa waiver program specified under 8 U.S.C.\u00a7 1187 for each fiscal year until September 30, 2007. The Secretary was also ordered to check for the implementation of precautionary measures to prevent the counterfeiting and theft of passports as well as ascertain that countries designated under the visa waiver program have established a program to develop tamper-resistant passports. The Secretary was also ordered to report back to Congress on whether consulate shopping was a problem. The last subtitle, which was introduced by Senators John Conyers and Patrick Leahy, allows for the preservation of immigration benefits for victims of terrorism, and the families of victims of terrorism. They recognized that some families, through no fault of their own, would either be ineligible for permanent residence in the United States because of being unable to make important deadlines because of the September 11 terrorist attacks, or had become ineligible to apply for special immigration status because their loved one died in the attacks. Title V: removing obstacles to investigating terrorism (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title V It allows the U.S. Attorney General to pay rewards pursuant of advertisements for assistance to the Department of Justice to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist acts, though amounts over$ US250, 000 may not be made or offered without the personal approval of the Attorney General or President, and once the award is approved the Attorney General must give written notice to the Chairman and ranking minority members of the Committee on Appropriations and the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 was amended to allow the Department of State to offer rewards, in consultation with the Attorney General, for the full or significant dismantling of any terrorist organization and to identify any key leaders of terrorist organizations. The Secretary of State was given authority to pay greater than$ US5 million if he so determines it would prevent terrorist actions against the United States and Canada. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act was amended to include terrorism or crimes of violence in the list of qualifying Federal offenses. Another perceived obstacle was to allow federal agencies to share information with federal law enforcement agencies. Thus, the act now allows federal officers who acquire information through electronic surveillance or physical searches to consult with federal law enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or protect against potential or actual attacks, sabotage or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power. Secret Service jurisdiction was extended to investigate computer fraud, access device frauds, false identification documents or devices, or any fraudulent activities against U.S. financial institutions. The General Education Provisions Act was amended to allow the U.S. Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General to collect and retain educational records relevant to an authorized investigation or prosecution of an offense that is defined as a Federal crime of terrorism and which an educational agency or institution possesses. The Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General must ``certify that there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the education records are likely to contain information (that a Federal crime of terrorism may be being committed).'' An education institution that produces education records in response to such a request is given legal immunity from any liability that rises from such a production of records. One of the most controversial aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special Agent in charge of a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests. This provision of the Act was challenged by the ACLU on behalf of an unknown party against the U.S. government on the grounds that NSLs violate the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because there is no way to legally oppose an NSL subpoena in court, and that it was unconstitutional not to allow a client to inform their Attorney as to the order because of the gag provision of the letters. The court's judgement found in favour of the ACLU's case, and they declared the law unconstitutional. Later, the USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized and amendments were made to specify a process of judicial review of NSLs and to allow the recipient of an NSL to disclose receipt of the letter to an attorney or others necessary to comply with or challenge the order. However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court struck down even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still not engage in a meaningful judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, ``extreme and overly broad,'' affirming that ``courts can not, consistent with the First Amendment, simply accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk.'' He also found that the FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill ``implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people.'' Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed for the first time the extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of an NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/ evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/ shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information. Title VI: victims and families of victims of terrorism (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title VI Title VI amended the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) to change how the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, improving the speedy provision of aid to families of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed in the line of duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the USA PATRIOT Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money in the Fund and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total in the Fund. A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the Director may make an annual grant from the Crime Victims Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to crime victims in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to victim service organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) andnon-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism. Title VII: increased information sharing for critical infrastructure Protection (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title VII Title VII has one section. The purpose of this title is to increase the ability of U.S. law enforcement to counter terrorist activity that crosses jurisdictional boundaries. It does this by amending the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include terrorism as a criminal activity. Title VIII: terrorism criminal Law (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title VIII Title VIII alters the definitions of terrorism and establishes orre-defines rules with which to deal with it. It redefined the term ``domestic terrorism'' to broadly include mass destruction as well as assassination or kidnapping as a terrorist activity. The definition also encompasses activities that are ``dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State'' and are intended to ``intimidate or coerce a civilian population,'' ``influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,'' or are undertaken ``to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping'' while in the jurisdiction of the United States. Terrorism is also included in the definition of racketeering. Terms relating tocyber-terrorism are also redefined, including the term ``protected computer,'' ``damage,'' ``conviction,'' ``person,'' and ``loss.'' New penalties were created to convict those who attack mass transportation systems. If the offender committed such an attack while no passenger was on board, they are fined and imprisoned for a maximum of 20 years. However, if the activity was undertaken while the mass transportation vehicle or ferry was carrying a passenger at the time of the offense, or the offense resulted in the death of any person, then the punishment is a fine and life imprisonment. The title amends the biological weapons statute to define the use of a biological agent, toxin, or delivery system as a weapon, other than when it is used for ``prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purposes.'' Penalties for anyone who can not prove reasonably that they are using a biological agent, toxin or delivery system for these purposes are 10 years imprisonment, a fine or both. A number of measures were introduced in an attempt to prevent and penalize activities that are deemed to support terrorism. It was made a crime to harbor or conceal terrorists, and those who do are subject to a fine or imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both. U.S. forfeiture law was also amended to allow authorities to seize all foreign and domestic assets from any group or individual that is caught planning to commit acts of terrorism against the U.S. or U.S. citizens. Assets may also be seized if they have been acquired or maintained by an individual or organization for the purposes of further terrorist activities. One section of the Act (section 805) prohibited ``material support'' for terrorists, and in particular included ``expert advice or assistance.'' In 2004, after the Humanitarian Law Project filed a civil action against the U.S. government, a Federal District Court struck this down as unconstitutionally vague; but in 2010 the Supreme Court upheld it. Congress later improved the law by defining the definitions of the ``material support or resources,'' ``training,'' and ``expert advise or resources.'' Cyberterrorism was dealt with in various ways. Penalties apply to those who either damage or gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and then commit a number of offenses. These offenses include causing a person to lose an aggregate amount greater than US$5,000, as well as adversely affecting someone's medical examination, diagnosis or treatment. It also encompasses actions that cause a person to be injured, a threat to public health or safety, or damage to a governmental computer that is used as a tool to administer justice, national defense or national security. Also prohibited was extortion undertaken via a protected computer. The penalty for attempting to damage protected computers through the use of viruses or other software mechanism was set to imprisonment for up to 10 years, while the penalty for unauthorized access and subsequent damage to a protected computer was increased to more than five years imprisonment. However, should the offense occur a second time, the penalty increases up to 20 years imprisonment. The act also specified the development and support of cybersecurity forensic capabilities. It directs the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories that have the capability of performing forensic examinations of intercepted computer evidence relating to criminal activity and cyberterrorism, and that have the capability of training and educating Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors in computer crime, and to ``facilitate and promote the sharing of Federal law enforcement expertise and information about the investigation, analysis, and prosecution of computer-related crime with State and local law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, including the use of multijurisdictional task forces.'' The sum of$50,000,000 was authorized for establishing such labs. Title IX: improved intelligence (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title IX Title IX amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to establish requirements and priorities for foreign intelligence collected under FISA and to provide assistance to the United States Attorney General to ensure that information derived from electronic surveillance or physical searches is disseminated for efficient and effective foreign intelligence purposes. With the exception of information that might jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation, it was made a requirement that the Attorney General, or the head of any other department or agency of the Federal Government with law enforcement responsibilities, disclose to the Director any foreign intelligence acquired by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Attorney General and Director of Central Intelligence were directed to develop procedures for the Attorney General to follow in order to inform the Director, in a timely manner, of any intention of investigating criminal activity of a foreign intelligence source or potential foreign intelligence source based on the intelligence tip-off of a member of the intelligence community. The Attorney General was also directed to develop procedures on how to best administer these matters. International terrorist activities were made to fall within the scope of foreign intelligence under the National Security Act. A number of reports were commissioned relating to various intelligence-related government centers. One was commissioned into the best way of setting up the National Virtual Translation Center, with the goal of developing automated translation facilities to assist with the timely and accurate translation of foreign intelligence information for elements of the U.S. intelligence community. The USA PATRIOT Act required this to be provided on February 1, 2002, however the report, entitled ``Director of Central Intelligence Report on the National Virtual Translation Center: A Concept Plan to Enhance the Intelligence Community's Foreign Language Capabilities, April 29, 2002'' was received more than two months late, which the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported was ``a delay which, in addition to contravening the explicit words of the statute, deprived the Committee of timely and valuable input into its efforts to craft this legislation.'' Another report was commissioned on the feasibility and desirability of reconfiguring the Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury. It was due by February 1, 2002 however, it was never written. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence later complained that ``(t) he Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of the Treasury failed to provide a report, this time in direct contravention of a section of the USA PATRIOT Act'' and they further directed ``that the statutorily-directed report be completed immediately, and that it should include a section describing the circumstances which led to the Director's failure to comply with lawful reporting requirements.'' Other measures allowed certain reports on intelligence and intelligence-related matters to be deferred until either February 1, 2002 or a date after February 1, 2002 if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede the work of officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities. Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly in the course of their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties. A sense of Congress was expressed that officers and employees of the intelligence community should be encouraged to make every effort to establish and maintain intelligence relationships with any person, entity, or group while they conduct lawful intelligence activities. Title X: miscellaneous (edit) Main article: Patriot Act, Title X Title X created or altered a number of miscellaneous laws that did not really fit into any other section of the USA PATRIOT Act. Hazmat licenses were limited to drivers who pass background checks and who can demonstrate they can handle the materials. The Inspector General of the Department of Justice was directed to appoint an official to monitor, review and report back to Congress all allegations of civil rights abuses against the DoJ. It amended the definition of ``electronic surveillance'' to exclude the interception of communications done through or from a protected computer where the owner allows the interception, or is lawfully involved in an investigation. Money laundering cases may now be brought in the district the money laundering was committed or where a money laundering transfer started from. Aliens who committed money laundering were also prohibited from entering the U.S. Grants were provided to first responders to assist them in responding to and preventing terrorism. US$5,000,000 was authorized to be provided to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to train police in South and East Asia. The Attorney General was directed to commission a study on the feasibility of using biometric identifiers to identify people as they attempt to enter the United States, and which would be connected to the FBI's database to flag suspected criminals. Another study was also commissioned to determine the feasibility of providing airlines names of suspected terrorists before they boarded flights. The Department of Defense was given temporary authority to use their funding for private contracts for security purposes. The last title also created a new Act called the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act which amended the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act to require telemarketers who call on behalf of charities to disclose the purpose and other information, including the name and mailing address of the charity the telemarketer is representing. It also increased the penalties from one-year imprisonment to five years imprisonment for those committing fraud by impersonating a Red Cross member.

Opponents of the Act have been quite vocal in asserting that it was passed opportunistically after the September 11 attacks, believing that there would have been little debate. They view the Act as one that was hurried through the Senate with little change before it was passed. (Senators Patrick Leahy and Russ Feingold proposed amendments to modify the final revision.) The sheer magnitude of the Act itself was noted by Michael Moore in his controversial film Fahrenheit 9/ 11. In one of the scenes of the movie, he records Congressman Jim McDermott alleging that no Senator had read the bill and John Conyers, Jr. as saying, ``We don't read most of the bills. Do you really know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed?'' Congressman Conyers then answers his own rhetorical question, asserting that if they did it would ``slow down the legislative process''. As a dramatic device, Moore then hired an ice-cream van and drove around Washington, D.C. with a loud speaker, reading out the Act to puzzled passers-by, which included a few Senators. However, Moore was not the only commentator to notice that not many people had read the Act. When Dahlia Lithwick and Julia Turne for Slate asked, ``How bad is PATRIOT, anyway?'', they decided that it was ``hard to tell'' and stated: The ACLU, in a new fact sheet challenging the DOJ Web site, wants you to believe that the act threatens our most basic civil liberties. Ashcroft and his roadies call the changes in law ``modest and incremental.'' Since almost nobody has read the legislation, much of what we think we know about it comes third-hand and spun. Both advocates and opponents are guilty of fear-mongering and distortion in some instances. One prime example of a controversy of the Patriot Act is shown in the case of Susan Lindauer. Another is the recent court case United States v. Antoine Jones. A nightclub owner was linked to a drug trafficking stash house via a law enforcement GPS tracking device attached to his car. It was placed there without a warrant, which caused a serious conviction obstacle for federal prosecutors in court. Through the years the case rose all the way to the United States Supreme Court where the conviction was overturned in favor of the defendant. The court found that increased monitoring of suspects caused by such legislation like the Patriot Act directly put the suspects 'Constitutional rights in jeopardy. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has criticized the law as unconstitutional, especially when ``the private communications of law-abiding American citizens might be intercepted incidentally'', while the Electronic Frontier Foundation held that the lower standard applied to wiretaps ``gives the FBI a 'blank check 'to violate the communications privacy of countless innocent Americans''. Others do not find the roving wiretap legislation to be as concerning. Professor David D. Cole of the Georgetown University Law Center, a critic of many of the provisions of the Act, found that though they come at a cost to privacy are a sensible measure while Paul Rosenzweig, a Senior Legal Research Fellow in the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation, argues that roving wiretaps are just a response to rapidly changing communication technology that is not necessarily fixed to a specific location or device. The Act also allows access to voicemail through a search warrant rather than through a title III wiretap order. James Dempsey, of the CDT, believes that it unnecessarily overlooks the importance of notice under the Fourth Amendment and under a Title III wiretap, and the EFF criticizes the provision's lack of notice. However, the EFF's criticism is more extensive--they believe that the amendment ``is in possible violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution'' because previously if the FBI listened to voicemail illegally, it could not use the messages in evidence against the defendant. Others disagree with these assessments. Professor Orin Kerr, of the George Washington University school of law, believes that the ECPA ``adopted a rather strange rule to regulate voicemail stored with service providers'' because ``under ECPA, if the government knew that there was one copy of an unopened private message in a person's bedroom and another copy on their remotely stored voicemail, it was illegal for the FBI to simply obtain the voicemail; the law actually compelled the police to invade the home and rifle through peoples 'bedrooms so as not to disturb the more private voicemail.'' In Professor Kerr's opinion, this made little sense and the amendment that was made by the USA PATRIOT Act was reasonable and sensible. The USA PATRIOT Act's expansion of court jurisdiction to allow the nationwide service of search warrants proved controversial for the EFF. They believe that agencies will be able to ``'shop 'for judges that have demonstrated a strong bias toward law enforcement with regard to search warrants, using only those judges least likely to say no--even if the warrant doesn't satisfy the strict requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution'', and that it reduces the likelihood that smaller ISPs or phone companies will try to protect the privacy of their clients by challenging the warrant in court--their reasoning is that ``a small San Francisco ISP served with such a warrant is unlikely to have the resources to appear before the New York court that issued it.'' They believe that this is bad because only the communications provider will be able to challenge the warrant as only they will know about it--many warrants are issued ex parte, which means that the target of the order is not present when the order is issued. For a time, the USA PATRIOT Act allowed for agents to undertake ``sneak and peek'' searches. Critics such as EPIC and the ACLU strongly criticized the law for violating the Fourth Amendment, with the ACLU going so far as to release an advertisement condemning it and calling for it to be repealed. However supporters of the amendment, such as Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and contributing editor to the New York City Journal, expressed the belief that it was necessary because the temporary delay in notification of a search order stops terrorists from tipping off counterparts who are being investigated. In 2004, FBI agents used this provision to search and secretly examine the home of Brandon Mayfield, who was wrongfully jailed for two weeks on suspicion of involvement in the Madrid train bombings. While the U.S. Government did publicly apologize to Mayfield and his family, Mayfield took it further through the courts. On September 26, 2007, Judge Ann Aiken found the law was, in fact, unconstitutional as the search was an unreasonable imposition on Mayfield and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Laws governing the material support of terrorism proved contentious. It was criticized by the EFF for infringement of freedom of association. The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid, U.S. citizens would not have been able to support the African National Congress (ANC) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization. They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members about international law, and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses. Another group, the Humanitarian Law Project, also objected to the provision prohibiting ``expert advise and assistance'' to terrorists and filed a suit against the U.S. government to have it declared unconstitutional. In 2004 a Federal District Court struck the provision down as unconstitutionally vague, but in 2010 the Supreme Court reversed that decision. Perhaps one of the biggest controversies involved the use of National Security Letters (NSLs) by the FBI. Because they allow the FBI to search telephone, email, and financial records without a court order, they were criticized by many parties, including the American Civil Liberties Union. Although FBI officials have a series of internal ``checks and balances'' that must be met before the issue of an NSL, Federal Judge Victor Marrero ruled the NSL provisions unconstitutional. In November 2005, BusinessWeek reported that the FBI had issued tens of thousands of NSLs and had obtained one million financial, credit, employment, and in some cases, health records from the customers of targeted Las Vegas businesses. Selected businesses included casinos, storage warehouses and car rental agencies. An anonymous Justice official claimed that such requests were permitted under section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act and despite the volume of requests insisted ``We are not inclined to ask courts to endorse fishing expeditions''. Before this was revealed, however, the ACLU challenged the constitutionality of NSLs in court. In April 2004, they filed suit against the government on behalf of an unknown Internet Service Provider who had been issued an NSL, for reasons unknown. In ACLU v. DoJ, the ACLU argued that the NSL violated the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because the USA PATRIOT Act failed to spell out any legal process whereby a telephone or Internet company could try to oppose an NSL subpoena in court. The court agreed, and found that because the recipient of the subpoena could not challenge it in court it was unconstitutional. Congress later tried to remedy this in a reauthorization Act, but because they did not remove thenon-disclosure provision a Federal court again found NSLs to be unconstitutional because they prevented courts from engaging in meaningful judicial review. Another provision of the USA PATRIOT Act has caused a great deal of consternation among librarians. Section 215 allows the FBI to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Among the ``tangible things'' that could be targeted, it includes ``books, records, papers, documents, and other items''. Supporters of the provision point out that these records are held by third parties, and therefore are exempt from a citizen's reasonable expectations of privacy and also maintain that the FBI has not abused the provision. As proof, then Attorney General John Ashcroft released information in 2003 that showed that section 215 orders had never been used. However, the American Library Association strongly objected to the provision, believing that library records are fundamentally different from ordinary business records, and that the provision would have a chilling effect on free speech. The association became so concerned that they formed a resolution condemning the USA PATRIOT Act, and which urged members to defend free speech and protect patrons 'privacy. They urged librarians to seek legal advice before complying with a search order and advised their members to only keeping records for as long as was legally needed. Consequently, reports started filtering in that librarians were shredding records to avoid having to comply with such orders. In 2005, Library Connection, a nonprofit consortium of 27 libraries in Connecticut, known as the Connecticut Four worked with the ACLU to lift a gag order for library records, challenging the government's power under Section 505 to silence four citizens who wished to contribute to public debate on the PATRIOT Act. This case became known as Doe v. Gonzales. In May 2006, the government finally gave up its legal battle to maintain the gag order. In a summary of the actions of the Connecticut Four and their challenge to the USA PATRIOT Act, Jones (2009: 223) notes: ``Librarians need to understand their country's legal balance between the protection of freedom of expression and the protection of national security. Many librarians believe that the interests of national security, important as they are, have become an excuse for chilling the freedom to read.'' Another controversial aspect of the USA PATRIOT Act is the immigration provisions that allow for the indefinite detention of any alien who the Attorney General believes may cause a terrorist act. Before the USA PATRIOT Act was passed, Anita Ramasastry, an associate professor of law and a director of the Shidler Center for Law, Commerce,& Technology at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle, Washington, accused the Act of depriving basic rights for immigrants to America, including legal permanent residents. She warned that ``Indefinite detention upon secret evidence--which the USA PATRIOT Act allows--sounds more like Taliban justice than ours. Our claim that we are attempting to build an international coalition against terrorism will be severely undermined if we pass legislation allowing even citizens of our allies to be incarcerated without basic U.S. guarantees of fairness and justice.'' Many other parties have also been strongly critical of the provision. Russell Feingold, in a Senate floor statement, claimed that the provision ``falls short of meeting even basic constitutional standards of due process and fairness (as it) continues to allow the Attorney General to detain persons based on mere suspicion''. The University of California passed a resolution condemning (among other things) the indefinite detention provisions of the Act, while the ACLU has accused the Act of giving the Attorney General ``unprecedented new power to determine the fate of immigrants... Worse, if the foreigner does not have a country that will accept them, they can be detained indefinitely without trial.'' Another controversial aspect of the USA PATRIOT Act is its effect on the privacy of Canadians living in the province of British Columbia (B.C.). British Columbia's privacy commissioner raises concerns that the USA PATRIOT Act will allow the United States government to access Canadians 'private information, such as personal medical records, that are outsourced to American companies. Although the government of B.C. has taken measures to prevent United States authorities from obtaining information, the widespread powers of the USA PATRIOT Act could overcome legislation that is passed in Canada. B.C. Privacy Commissioner David Loukidelis stated in a report on the consequences of the USA PATRIOT Act, ``once information is sent across borders, it's difficult, if not impossible, to control''. In an effort to maintain their privacy, British Columbia placed amendments on the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA), which was enacted as law on October 21, 2004. These amendments aim to place more firm limitations on ``storing, accessing, and disclosing of B.C. public sector data by service providers.'' These laws only pertain to public sector data and do not cover trans-border or private sector data in Canada. The public sector establishments include an estimated2,000 ``government ministries, hospitals, boards of health, universities and colleges, school boards, municipal governments and certain Crown corporations and agencies.'' In response to these laws, many companies are now specifically opting to host their sensitive data outside the United States. Legal action has been taken in Nova Scotia to protect the province from the USA PATRIOT Act's data collecting methods. On November 15, 2007 the government of Nova Scotia passed a legislation aimed to protect Nova Scotians 'personal information from being brought forward by the USA PATRIOT Act. The act was entitled ``The new Personal Information International Disclosure Protection Act''. The goal of the act is to establish requirements to protect personal information from being revealed, as well as punishments for failing to do so. Justice Minister Murray Scott stated, ``This legislation will help ensure that Nova Scotians 'personal information will be protected. The act outlines the responsibilities of public bodies, municipalities and service providers and the consequences if these responsibilities are not fulfilled.'' In the 1980s, the Bank of Nova Scotia was the center of an early,pre-Internet data-access case that led to the disclosure of banking records. After suspected abuses of the USA PATRIOT Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds. He released a statement saying ``While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have always worried about potential abuses.'' He added: ``Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive andun-American.'' Reauthorizations (edit) The USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized by three bills. The first, the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005, was passed by both houses of Congress in July 2005. This bill reauthorized provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. It created new provisions relating to the death penalty for terrorists, enhancing security at seaports, new measures to combat the financing of terrorism, new powers for the Secret Service,anti-methamphetamine initiatives and a number of other miscellaneous provisions. The second reauthorization act, the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006, amended the first and was passed in February 2006. The first act reauthorized all but two of the provisions of Title II that would have expired. Two sections were changed to sunset on December 31, 2009: section 206--the roving wiretap provision--and section 215, which allowed access to business records under FISA. Section 215 was amended further regardless so as to give greater judicial oversight and review. Such orders were also restricted to be authorized by only the FBI Director, the FBI Deputy Director, or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security, and minimization procedures were specified to limit the dissemination and collection of such information. Section 215 also had a ``gag'' provision, which was changed to allow the defendant to contact their Attorney. However, the change also meant that the defendant was also made to tell the FBI who he (or she) was disclosing the order to--this requirement was removed by the USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act. On Saturday, February 27, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law legislation that would temporarily extend, for one year, three controversial provisions of the Patriot Act that had been set to expire: Authorize court-approved roving wiretaps that permit surveillance on multiple phones. Allow court-approved seizure of records and property inanti-terrorism operations. Permit surveillance against a so-called lone wolf, anon-U.S. citizen engaged in terrorism who may not be part of a recognized terrorist group. In a vote on February 8, 2011, the House of Representatives considered a further extension of the Act through the end of 2011. House leadership moved the extension bill under suspension of the rules, which is intended for noncontroversial legislation and requires two-thirds majority to pass. After the vote, the extension bill did not pass; 277 members voted in favor, which was less than the 290 votes needed to pass the bill under suspension of the rules. Without an extension, the Act was set to expire on February 28, 2011. However, it eventually passed, 275-144. The FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 was signed into law February 25, 2011. On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama used an Autopen to sign the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act while he was in France: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the ``library records provision''), and conducting surveillance of ``lone wolves''--individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups. Republican leaders questioned if the use of the Autopen met the constitutional requirements for signing a bill into law. As NSL provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act had been struck by the courts the reauthorization Act amended the law in an attempt to make them lawful. It provided for judicial review and the legal right of a recipient to challenge the validity of the letter. The reauthorization act still allowed NSLs to be closed and all evidence to be presented in camera and ex parte. Gag provisions were maintained, but were not automatic. They only occurred when the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI or a Special Agent in Charge in a Bureau field office certified that disclosure would result in ``a danger to the national security of the United States, interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interference with diplomatic relations, or danger to the life or physical safety of any person''. However, should there be nonon-disclosure order, the defendant can disclose the fact of the NSL to anyone who can render them assistance in carrying out the letter, or to an attorney for legal advice. Again, however, the recipient was ordered to inform the FBI of such a disclosure. Because of the concern over the chilling effects of such a requirement, the Additional Reauthorization Amendments Act removed the requirement to inform the FBI that the recipient spoke about the NSL to their Attorney. Later, the Additional Reauthorization Amendments Act excluded libraries from receiving NSLs, except where they provide electronic communications services. The reauthorization Act also ordered the Attorney General submit a reportsemi-annually to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on all NSL request made under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Changes were made to the roving wiretap provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. Applications and orders for such wiretaps must describe the specific target of the electronic surveillance if the identity of the target is not known. If the nature and location of each of the facilities or places targeted for surveillance is not known, then after 10 days the agency must provide notice to the court. The notice must include the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance was directed. It must also describe the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify the applicant's belief that each new surveillance place or facility under surveillance is or was being used by the target of the surveillance. The applicant must also provide a statement detailing any proposed minimization procedures that differ from those contained in the original application or order, that may be necessitated by a change in the facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed. Applicants must detail the total number of electronic surveillances that have been or are being conducted under the authority of the order. Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act was modified. Previously it stated that delayed notifications would be made to recipients of ``sneak and peek'' searches in a ``reasonable period''. This was seen as unreasonable, as it was undefined and could potentially be used indefinitely. Thus, the reauthorization act changed this to a period not exceeding 30 days after the date of the execution of the search warrant. Courts were given the opportunity to extend this period if they were provided good cause to do so. Section 213 states that delayed notifications could be issued if there is ``reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the execution of the warrant may have an adverse result''. This was criticized, particularly by the ACLU, for allowing potential abuse by law enforcement agencies and was later amended to prevent a delayed notification ``if the adverse results consist only of unduly delaying a trial.''. In September 2007 an Oregon US District Court struck down the Sneak and Peak provisions of the USA PATRIOT ACT, but in December 2009 the Ninth Circuit overturned this decision. The reauthorization act also legislates increased congressional oversight for emergency disclosures by communication providers undertaken under section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The duration of FISA surveillance and physical search orders were increased. Surveillance performed against ``lone wolf terrorists'' under section 207 of the USA PATRIOT Act were increased to 120 days for an initial order, while pen registers and trap and trace device extensions under FISA were increased from 90 days to a year. The reauthorization act also increased congressional oversight, requiring asemi-annual report into physical searches and the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices under FISA. The ``lone wolf terrorist'' provision (Section 207) was a sunset provision that also was to have expired, however this was enhanced by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The reauthorization act extended the expiration date to December 31, 2009. The amendment to material support law done in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was also made permanent. The definition of terrorism was further expanded to include receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization and narcoterrorism. Other provisions of the reauthorization act was to merge the law outlawing train wrecking (18 U.S.C.\u00a7 992) and the law outlawing attacks on mass transportation systems (18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1993) into a new section of Title 18 of the U.S. Code (18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1992) and also to criminalize the act of planning a terrorist attack against a mass transport system. Forfeiture law was further changed and now assets within U.S. jurisdiction will be seized for illegally trafficking in nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons technology or material, if such offense is punishable under foreign law by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. Alternatively, this applies if similar punishment would be so punishable if committed within the U.S. A sense of Congress was further expressed that victims of terrorism should be entitled to the forfeited assets of terrorists.

The law has permitted the FBI to issue NSLs demanding private information about people within the United States without court approval, and to gag those who receive NSLs from discussing them. The court found that the gag power was unconstitutional and that because the statute prevented courts from engaging in meaningful judicial review of gags, it violated the First Amendment and the principle of separation of powers.

For the individuals, see Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse. Dylan and Cole Sprouse Cole (left) and Dylan (right) Sprouse, with Piper Reese at the 2009 Power of Youth event Cole Mitchell Sprouse Dylan Thomas Sprouse (1992-08-04) August 4, 1992 (age 25) Arezzo, Tuscany, Italy Nationality American Alma mater New York University Occupation Actors Years active 1993--2012; 2015--present Dylan Thomas Sprouse and Cole Mitchell Sprouse (born August 4, 1992) are American actors. They are twins and are referred to as the Sprouse brothers or Sprouse Bros. Their first major theatrical film role was in the 1999 comedy, Big Daddy, in which theyco-starred with Adam Sandler. They later appeared in several television sitcoms and starred in the straight-to-DVD films I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Just for Kicks. From 2005 until 2008, they starred in the Disney Channel sitcom The Suite Life of Zack& Cody. As a result of the series 'success, the media has termed them ``heartthrobs'' and ``overwhelming draws'' among preteen and teen audiences. The following year, the brothers launched a franchise known as the Sprouse Bros brand, which included a clothing line, book series and magazine. The majority of the Sprouses 'franchise ended in 2008, except for their clothing line. The Suite Life of Zack& Cody was retooled in 2008 as The Suite Life on Deck, in which the brothers reprised their roles as Zack and Cody. The Suite Life on Deck went on to become the most-watched tween/ children's television show in 2008 and 2009. The show ended in May 2011. They also starred in The Suite Life Movie, which aired in March of the same year. They began cultivating an adult image by starring in the independent theatrical suspense film The Kings of Appletown in 2009. Dylan and Cole were two of the wealthiest children alive in 2007, and in 2010, the Sprouse brothers were the highest-paid teenage Disney television actors, earning$40,000 per episode combined. MSN reported by the end of the 2000s that the twin brothers became the richest teenage twins in the world. In 2010, the brothers were accepted to New York University. They deferred admission for one year, and attended the university from 2011 to 2015. Both Cole and Dylan have confirmed they wish to pursue actingpost-university. Contents (hide) 1 Early lives 2 Acting 3 Sprouse Bros brand 4 Personal lives 5 Filmography 5.1 Film 5.2 Television 6 Awards and nominations 7 Discography 8 References 9 External links Early lives The Sprouses were born at a small hospital called Clinica Tanganelli in Arezzo, Italy, to American parents Matthew Sprouse and Melanie Wright, while they were teaching at an English language school in Tuscany. Dylan was named after Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, and Cole is named after jazz singer and pianist Nat King Cole. Dylan is 15 minutes older than Cole. They have German ancestry. The boys moved back to the United States four months after their birth to their parents 'native Long Beach, California. Some of the money Dylan and Cole earned by acting was used to buy a house in Calabasas, California, where their family still lived as of summer 2012. Acting Dylan (left) and Cole (right), with their acting coach, Gary Spatz c. 2007 The Sprouses began acting at the age of eight months following a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for diapers, switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series Grace Under Fire. In 1999, the boys appeared in their first major feature film, Big Daddy, in which they shared the role of a five-year-old boy named Julian who is adopted by Adam Sandler's character, Sonny Koufax. Though the film received mixed reviews, the two were nominated for multiple awards for their role in the film. However, they did not win any. The same year, the boys also had a minor role in the thriller The Astronaut's Wife. The Sprouses have noted that after Big Daddy's release, they entered a slow period in their careers and were not cast in any major roles for a time. During the early 2000s, the twins appeared in episodes of The Nightmare Room and That '70s Show, as well as in Mad TV and portrayed roles in the feature films The Master of Disguise and Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights. Cole began appearing in episodes of the television show Friends, as Ross Geller's son Ben in 2001; this role was not shared with Dylan. They both appeared in I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Just for Kicks, both of which were family films that received a direct-to-video release. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews said of their acting in Just for Kicks that the brothers ``aren't the worst child actors I've ever seen,... but they certainly leave a lot to be desired.'' Dylan and Cole were later cast in the Disney Channel original series The Suite Life of Zack& Cody, where they portrayed identical twins Zack and Cody Martin, respectively. The series, which debuted in March 2005, became a ratings success. As part of their involvement with Disney, the brothers also became part of the 11-member group, the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, and sang the song ``A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes'' along with the members of the circle, for a video that was released as bonus material in the special edition version of the Disney film Cinderella. They also participated in the Disney Channel Games. Cole Sprouse at the 2010 White House Easter Egg roll The Sprouses played one character, Jeremiah, in the independent film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things. The film was produced in 2004 but not given a theatrical release until March 2006, when it played at three theatres in the United States, ultimately grossing$29,000 domestically. Harvey Karten praised their acting, stating that ``acting is superlative all around'', and Tamara Straus of the San Francisco Chronicle called them ``the movie's only saving grace''. In 2007, the two filmed A Modern Twain Story: The Prince and the Pauper. Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media said the film was a ``slow story for Zack and Cody fans only''. The Sprouse brothers both had voice roles in the animated film Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen alongside Brenda Song and Emily Osment. Dylan played the voice of Shasta in Disney's ``Snow Buddies''. The brothers both starred in the theatrical film The Kings of Appletown, which is based on the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The film was directed by Bobby Moresco and written by Amanda Moresco. Shot in New Braunfels, Texas, the film was originally estimated to be released in the winter of 2008. Kings of Appletown had a limited theatrical release on December 12, 2009 and was officially released at the Newport Beach Film Festival in April 2010. They appeared on the cover of the May 2009 issue People Magazine, in an eighty-page special edition issue devoted to The Suite Life on Deck. The twin brothers began filming another Modern Twain Story film in the summer of 2009. The film was tentatively titled ``Sivilized'' and was a modern version of Huckleberry Finn. However, inmid-2010, Dylan stated that they would not be doing the film, in part because they ``outgrew'' the film. They became the new face of the children's yogurt, Dannon Danimals, in 2009; their endorsement deal was renewed in 2010. The twin brothers signed an endorsement deal with Nintendo DS in August 2010. As of early tomid-2011, Dylan and Cole were not in any acting projects and were focusing instead on college as well as art and photography, respectively. However, Dylan has stated that they would both like to continue acting while in college. Dylan and Cole are represented by William Morris Endeavor as of 2011. In January 2016, Cole was cast as Jughead Jones in The CW's teen drama series Riverdale, based on Archie. Sprouse Bros brand In 2005, the Sprouse brothers signed a licensing agreement with Dualstar Entertainment to produce Sprouse Bros branded merchandise for the preteen and teenage market, the Sprouse Bros brand included a clothing line, comics series and a magazine, as well as personal hygiene line and a line of sportswear. Dylan said of the brand that they wanted to ``reach out to the nerd group and the cool group'' and ``appeal to everybody''. A magazine targeting boys was launched by Dualstar and Leisure Publishing LLC in 2006 called Sprouse Bros. Code. Simon& Schuster Inc. published two volumes of a book series titled Sprouse Bros. 47 R.O.N.I.N., which was described as featuring the Sprouse twins as ``young James Bonds or undercover agents''; the book series continued. In 2008, the brothers ended their association with the Olsens 'Dualstar, but they continued to sell their clothing line. The items in their clothing lines were sold exclusively online untilmid-March 2012, when the online store could no longer be accessed. Dylan Sprouse at the 2010 White House Easter Egg roll Personal lives Dylan Sprouse has stated that the experience of coming to fame after the success of The Suite Life of Zack& Cody is ``kind of scary, how fast everything is moving'' and that a year prior ``none of this was happening, it was just doing Suite Life'', and that he was excited for the future. While filming The Suite Life of Zack& Cody, the both of them received on-set tutoring for three hours each day for school, and said they were getting ``straight A's and honors''. In their last year of high school, the brothers both took Advanced Placement classes. Dylan took AP Psychology and AP Spanish, and Cole took AP Psychology and AP Government. The twins 'family has three dogs: Bubba, which belongs to Dylan and Cole; Pinky, who is their father's; and Curry, their stepmother's. Their favorite actor andco-star is Adam Sandler. Dylan has said that Adam is ``a role model in acting'' and that they learned a lot about comedy from him. Inmid-2010, Dylan launched a site for his art called Sprouse Arts, and inmid-2011, Cole launched a site for his photography called Cole Sprouse Photography. In 2010, the brothers were both accepted to New York University. They had initial plans to attend the university in the fall of 2010; however, they deferred for one year. Dylan initially planned on majoring in fine/ studio arts and minoring in economics while Cole planned on majoring in film and television production and minoring in drama. Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to plan their own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the humanities and archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design. In 2011, Dylan was elected president of the Third Avenue North residence hall at New York University. Both brothers graduated in May 2015; they told Entertainment magazine that they had walked away with each other's diplomas at the graduation ceremony. In 2012, Dylan and Cole were officially appointed as the International Ambassadors of the Koyamada Foundation. They traveled to Japan with Shin Koyamada to empower the youth of Japan to better themselves and rebuild Japan as a society as well as to deepen the friendly relations and brotherhood between the youth of Japan and America in August 2013. As of 2013, Dylan was working as a host at a New York City restaurant, which he explained was a result of his desire to try a new experience, as he said, ``working somewhat below the means I'm used to, as well as a way to socialize and get out of the house.'' Since 2014, Dylan has commentated a few Super Smash Bros. tournaments. In early 2017, Dylan announced that with two partners he was preparing to openAll-Wise Meadery in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York; he is the brewmaster. He disclosed that he has been a Heathen since he was 15.

C94137 Wat 1995 The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963 (1995) is a historical-fiction novel by Christopher Paul Curtis. First published in 1995, it was reprinted in 1997. It tells the story of a loving African-American family living in the town of Flint, Michigan, in 1963. When the oldest son (Byron) begins to get into a bit of trouble, the parents decide he should spend the summer and possibly the next school year with Grandma Sands in Birmingham, Alabama. The entire family travels there together by car, and during their visit, tragic events take place. The book was adapted for a TV movie of the same name, produced in 2013 and aired on the Hallmark Channel. Contents (hide) 1 Background and setting 2 Plot 3 Characters 4 Author information 5 Adaptations 6 References 7 External links Background and setting (edit) The book takes place from approximately January to October 1963, a turbulent time during the Civil Rights Movement. The Watson family is fictional, but the characters are based on members of the author's family, including himself, and many of the events in the first half of the book are based on events from the author's childhood. Events later in the story center on the historic 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, soon after the civil rights protests had gained negotiation with white city leaders for integration. KKK members bombed the church on September 15, 1963, killing four girls and injuring many more. In the novel, the incident is depicted as occurring a bit earlier than the historical date, allowing the Watson family to still be on summer vacation in Birmingham when it took place. The bombing was a catalyst for increased activity in the Civil Rights Movement and work on voter registration in Mississippi, during Freedom Summer of 1964. Plot (edit) The novel is a first-person account narrarated by Kenny Watson, who lives in Flint, Michigan with his parents, Daniel and Wilona Watson, his older brother Byron, and younger sister Joetta. The opening chapters establish Kenny as a very bright and shy 4th grader who has difficulty making true friends until Rufus Fry arrives in town from Arkansas. Rufus is also bullied by the students at Clark Elementary for his ``country'' clothes and accent, making Kenny reluctant to befriend him at first, but they are soon inseparable. Kenny is alternatively bullied and protected by his 13 year old brother Byron, whom he calls ``an official teenage juvenile delinquent''. Byron has been retained twice because he often skips school and is still in 6th grade. He invents a series of ``fantastic adventures'' which constantly get him into trouble and include playing with matches in the house, abusing his parent's credit at the corner grocery store to buy himself treats, and getting a ``conk'' hairstyle against his parents 'orders. Daniel and Wilona eventually become so frustrated with their inability to ``straighten out'' Byron that they decide to send him to Birmingham, Alabama to live with Grandma Sands (WIlona's mother) for at least the summer and possibly an entire year. As soon as the school year concludes, the Watsons ready their car (``the Brown Bomber'') and embark on a roadtrip from Flint to Birmingham to deliver Byron. Kenny had been looking forward to the ``battle royal'' between his grandma and Byron, but is disappointed when just a few sharp words from the ``old, old'' lady have Byron speaking respectfully and generally behaving himself, causing Kenny to seek out his own ``adventures''. Grandma Sands had warned the children to avoid a particular local swimming hole because of a dangerous ``whirlpool'', which Kenny misheard as ``Wool Pooh'' due to her thick Alabama accent. Kenny wants to swim there anyway, and is frustrated when Byron and Joetta refuse to go along. Ignoring the warnings of both Grandma Sands and Byron, Kenny jumps into the seemingly tranquil pool and edges deeper and deeper water until he loses his footing and almost drowns. Remembering his grandmother's words, he imagines that a strange monster he thinks is the mysterious ``Wool Pooh'' swam up from below to grab his ankle and pull him under. Byron returns and jumps in to save Kenny just in time. He later insists that there was nothing else in the water, but Kenny is convinced that the Wool Pooh actually exists. Shortly afterwards, a bomb goes off at a nearby church where Joetta is attending Sunday school. (This was the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, a real historical event.) Kenny wanders into the still-smoking church in the immediate aftermath looking for his sister, but instead sees the Wool Pooh in the smoke clinging to a torn girl's shoe that looks like Joetta's. In shock, he walks back to Grandma Sands 'house without anyone noticing that he had been at the church, and he's again shocked and confused to find Joetta already there. She claims that it was Kenny who had called her away from the church and led her home, and she does not even know that a bombing had taken place right after she'd left Sunday school. As soon as they realize that Joetta is safe, the Watsons decide to immediately return home to Flint, trying to avoid explaining the full implications of what has happened to the children. Kenny is unable to process the events in Birmingham and avoids his family and friends over the ensuing weeks, instead spending many hours hiding behind the sofa. Byron eventually coaxes him out and gets Kenny to talk about what happened, which finally brings a flood of tears from Kenny. Encouraging his little brother to ``keep on stepping'', Byron explains that although the world is not perfect, he has to keep moving on.

Middle 19th century, Walters Art Museum The names of the days of the week in many languages are derived from the names of the classical planets in Hellenistic astrology, which were in turn named after contemporary deities, a system introduced in by the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity. In some other languages, the days are named after corresponding deities of the regional culture, either beginning with Sunday or with Monday. In the international standard ISO 8601, Monday is treated as the first day of the week.

Our earliest evidence for this new system is a Pompeiian graffito referring to the 6th February (viii idus Februarius) of the year AD 60 as dies solis (``Sunday''). Another early witness is a reference to a lost treatise by Plutarch, written in about AD 100, which addressed the question of Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the actual order?. The days were named after the planets of Hellenistic astrology, in the order Sun, Moon, Mars (Ares), Mercury (Hermes), Jupiter (Zeus), Venus (Aphrodite) and Saturn (Cronos). The seven-day week spread throughout the Roman Empire in Late Antiquity. By the 4th century, it was in wide use throughout the Empire, and it had also reached India and China.

The date of the introduction of this system is not known exactly, but it must have happened later than AD 200 but before the introduction of Christianity during the 6th to 7th centuries, i.e., during the final phase or soon after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. This period is later than the Common Germanic stage, but still during the phase of undifferentiated West Germanic. The names of the days of the week in North Germanic languages were not calqued from Latin directly, but taken from the West Germanic names. Sunday: Old English Sunnand\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8sunn\u0251nd\u00e6j)), meaning ``sun's day''. This is a translation of the Latin phrase dies Solis. English, like most of the Germanic languages, preserves the original pagan/ sun associations of the day. Many other European languages, including all of the Romance languages, have changed its name to the equivalent of ``the Lord's day'' (based on Ecclesiastical Latin dies Dominica). In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology the Sun is personified as Sunna/ S\u00f3l. Monday: Old English M\u014dnand\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8mo\u02d0n\u0251nd\u00e6j)), meaning ``Moon's day''. This is equivalent to the Latin name dies lunae. In North Germanic mythology, the Moon is personified as M\u00e1ni. Tuesday: Old English T\u012bwesd\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8ti\u02d0wezd\u00e6j)), meaning ``Tiw's day''. Tiw (Norse T\u00fdr) was a one-handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism. The name of the day is also related to the Latin name dies Martis, ``Day of Mars''. Wednesday: Old English W\u014ddnesd\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8wo\u02d0dnezd\u00e6j)) meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden (known as \u00d3\u00f0inn among the North Germanic peoples), and a prominent god of the Anglo-Saxons (and other Germanic peoples) in England until about the seventh century. It is also vaguely related to the Latin counterpart dies Mercurii, ``Day of Mercury''. The connection between Mercury and Odin is more strained than the other syncretic connections. The usual explanation is that both Wodan and Mercury were considered psychopomps, or guides of souls after death, in their respective mythologies; both are also associated with poetic and musical inspiration. The Icelandic Mi\u00f0viku, German Mittwoch, Low German Middeweek and Finnish keskiviikko all meanmid-week. Thursday: Old English \u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8\u03b8u\u02d0nrezd\u00e6j)), meaning '\u00deunor's day '. \u00deunor means thunder or its personification, the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor. Similarly Dutch donderdag, German Donnerstag ('thunder's day '), Finnish torstai, and Scandinavian Torsdag ('Thor's day '). Thor's day corresponds to Latin dies Iovis, ``day of Jupiter''. Friday: Old English Fr\u012bged\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8fri\u02d0jed\u00e6j)), meaning the day of the Anglo-Saxon goddess Fr\u00edge. The Norse name for the planet Venus was Friggjarstjarna, 'Frigg's star '. It is based on the Latin dies Veneris, ``Day of Venus''. Saturday: the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English, named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus, father of Zeus and many Olympians. Its original Anglo-Saxon rendering was S\u00e6turnesd\u00e6g (pronounced (\u02c8s\u00e6turnezd\u00e6j)). In Latin, it was dies Saturni, ``Day of Saturn''. The Scandinavian L\u00f8rdag/ L\u00f6rdag deviates significantly as it has no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon; it derives from old Norse laugardagr, literally ``washing-day''. The German Sonnabend (mainly used in northern and eastern Germany) and the Low German words S\u00fcnnavend mean ``Sunday Eve'', the German word Samstag (mainly used in southern and western Germany) derives from the name for Shabbat.

Knowledge of Greek astrology existed since about the 2nd century BC, but references to the v\u0101ra occur somewhat later, during the Gupta period (Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti, c. 3rd to 5th century), i.e. at roughly the same period the system was introduced in the Roman Empire.

names of the days of the week. Hindu astrology adopted the concept of days under the regency of a planet under the term v\u0101ra, the days of the week being called \u0101ditya-, soma-, ma\u1e45gala-, budha-, guru-, \u015bukra-, and \u015bani-v\u0101ra. \u015bukr\u00e1 is a name of Venus (regarded as a son of Bh\u1e5bgu); guru is here a title of B\u1e5bhaspati, and hence of Jupiter; budha ``Mercury'' is regarded as a son of Soma, i.e. the Moon.

The Chinese seem to have adopted the seven-day week from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century, although by which route is not entirely clear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century by Manichaeans, via the country of Kang (a Central Asian polity near Samarkand). The 4th-century date, according to the Cihai encyclopedia, is due to a reference to Fan Ning (\u7bc4 \u5be7/ \u8303 \u5b81), an astrologer of the Jin Dynasty. The renewed adoption from Manichaeans in the 8th century (Tang Dynasty) is documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yi Jing and the Ceylonese Buddhist monk Bu Kong. The Chinese transliteration of the planetary system was soon brought to Japan by the Japanese monk Kobo Daishi; surviving diaries of the Japanese statesman Fujiwara Michinaga show the seven day system in use in Heian Period Japan as early as 1007. In Japan, the seven day system was kept in use (for astrological purposes) until its promotion to a full-fledged (Western-style) calendrical basis during the Meiji era. In China, with the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, Monday through Saturday in China are now named after the luminaries implicitly with the numbers.

Numbered days of the week (edit) Days numbered from Sunday (edit) See also: Feria Sunday comes first in order in calendars shown in the table below. In the Judeo-Christian or Abrahamic tradition, the first day of the week is Sunday. Biblical Sabbath (corresponding to Saturday), when God rested from six-day Creation, made the day following Sabbath the first day of the week (corresponding to Sunday). Seventh-day Sabbaths were sanctified for celebration and rest. After the week was adopted in early Christianity, Sunday remained the first day of the week, but also gradually displaced Saturday as the day of celebration and rest, being considered the Lord's Day. Saint Martin of Dumio (c. 520--580), archbishop of Braga, decided not to call days by pagan gods and to use ecclesiastic terminology to designate them. While the custom of numbering the days of the week was mostly prevalent in the Eastern Church, Portuguese and Galician, due to Martin's influence, are the only Romance languages in which the names of the days come from numbers rather than planetary names. Icelandic is a special case within the Germanic languages, maintaining only the Sun and Moon (sunnudagur and m\u00e1nudagur respectively), while dispensing with the names of the explicitly heathen gods in favour of a combination of numbered days and days whose names are linked to pious or domestic routine (f\u00f6studagur, ``Fasting Day'' and laugardagur, ``Washing Day''). The ``washing day'' is also used in other North Germanic languages, but otherwise the names correspond to those of English.

numbered from Monday (edit) The ISO prescribes Monday as the first day of the week with ISO-8601 for software date formats. The Slavic, Baltic and Uralic languages (except Finnish and partially Estonian) adopted numbering but took Monday rather than Sunday as the ``first day''. This convention is also found in some Austronesian languages whose speakers were converted to Christianity by European missionaries. In Slavic languages, some of the names correspond to numerals after Sunday: compare Russian vtornik ``Tuesday'' and vtoroj ``the following'', chetverg ``Thursday'' and chetvertyj ``the fourth'', pyatnitsa ``Friday'' and pyatyj ``the fifth''; see also the Notes.

The modern Chinese names for the days of the week are based on a simple numerical sequence. The word for 'week '(which is literally translated to 'star day ') is followed by a number indicating the day: 'Monday 'is literally 'star day one ', 'Tuesday 'is 'star day two ', etc. The exception is Sunday, where r\u00ec (\u65e5), meaning 'sun 'or 'day ', is used instead of a number.

Saturday is therefore the first day of the week, as it is the day that includes the first night of the week in Arabic. Etymologically speaking, Swahili has two ``fifth'' days. The words for Saturday through Wednesday contain the Bantu-derived Swahili words for ``one'' through ``five''. The word for Thursday, Alhamisi, is of Arabic origin and means ``the fifth'' (day). The word for Friday, Ijumaa, is also Arabic and means (day of) ``gathering'' for the Friday noon prayers in Islam.

Sunday uses the Arabic name, which is based on numbering, because a Jewish language was not likely to adapt a name based on ``Lord's Day'' for Sunday. As in Spanish, the Ladino name for Saturday is based on Sabbath. However, as a Jewish language--and with Saturday being the actual day of rest in the Jewish community--Ladino directly adapted the Hebrew name, Shabbat.

It was organized by African Americans and whites from Mississippi to challenge the legitimacy of the regular Mississippi Democratic Party, which allowed participation only by whites, when African Americans made up 40% of the state population. Contents (hide) 1 Origins 2 Building the party 3 State Convention in Jackson, Mississippi 4 1964 Democratic National Convention 5 Aftermath 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading 9 External links Origins (edit) For generations, African Americans had endured widespread denial of their voting rights in Mississippi, which used poll taxes, literacy tests and comprehension tests administered by white agents, and other means to prevent blacks from registering and voting. They had been nearly excluded from the political system since 1890 by passage that year by white Democrats of a new state constitution incorporating these devices and by the practices of the ruling white Democrats in the decades since. Participation in the state Democratic Party was limited to whites only. Starting in 1961, SNCC and COFO had waged campaigns to register black voters; they often encountered violent opposition, with activists being beaten, and were not able to register many African Americans. The founding Party members were: Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and Robert Parris Moses, residents of Mississippi. In June 1963, African Americans attempted to cast votes in the Mississippi primary election but were prevented from doing so. This contest to elect Democratic candidates was essentially the only competitive race, as the state was a one-party jurisdiction. Unable to vote in the official election, they organized an alternative ``Freedom Ballot'' for an election to take place at the same time as the scheduled November voting. With this election seen as a protest action to dramatize the denial of their constitutional voting rights, close to80,000 people cast freedom ballots for an integrated slate of candidates. Building the Party (edit) With participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, COFO built on the success of the Freedom Ballot by formally establishing the MFDP in April 1964 as anon-discriminatory,non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. The MFDP hoped to replace the regulars as the officially-recognized Democratic Party organization in Mississippi by winning the Mississippi seats at the 1964 Democratic National Convention for a slate of delegates elected by disenfranchised black and white Mississippians and white sympathizers. Building the MFDP was a major thrust of the Freedom Summer project. After it proved to be impossible to register black voters against the opposition of state officials, Freedom Summer volunteers switched to building the MFDP using a simple, alternate process of signing up party supporters that did not require blacks to openly defy the power structure by trying to register at the courthouse or for blacks and poor whites to take a complex and unfair literacy test. By the end of August 1964 the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party had gained so much attention nationally that its delegates had80,000 members belonging to their racially integrated party. In time some activists from the Northeast, including some of the Freedom Riders, would come to dominate the administration of the new party. State convention in jackson, Mississippi (edit) On August 4, before the state convention, the bodies of James Earl Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were discovered buried in an earthen dam. They had been workers with CORE, registering people to vote for the MFDP, and had been murdered for their activism. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. The murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner drew national attention and generated outrage, emboldening the MFDP to be the party to represent the state of Mississippi. August 6, 1964, the MFDP held a statewide convention before attending the DNC;2,500 people showed up at the Masonic Temple. They decided to take the party to the national credentials committee and attempt to be seated as the delegation from Mississippi. Joseph Rauh, the MFDP legal council and a foremost civil liberties attorney, spoke at the convention. He said that the MFDP was the only party in the state loyal to the national Democratic Party and ``The chances of success were excellent''. Ella Baker was the keynote speaker at the state convention. She did not deliver the kind of address that the people were expecting on voting and rights but made a statement about society: ``I'm not trying to make you feel good. We have to know what we are dealing with and we can't deal with things just because we feel we ought to have our rights. We have to deal with them on the basis of knowledge that we gain... through sending our children through certain kinds of courses, through sitting down and reading at night instead of spending our time at the television and radio just listening to what's on. But we must spend our time reading some of things that help us to understand this South we live in.'' The state convention gave the MFDP confidence in their ability to effect change on the national level. They elected Fannie Lou Hamer, E.W. Steptoe, Winson Hudson, Hazel Palmer, Victoria Gray, Rev. Ed King, Aaron Henry and Annie Devine as electors from the state to the national convention. The day after the state convention, James Chaney was buried in his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. Dave Dennis gave an impassioned speech about the loss of this young man. ``Those are the people who don't care... That includes the President on down to the governor of the state of Mississippi... I blame the people in Washington D.C., and on down in the state of Mississippi for what happened just as much as I blame those who pulled the trigger... He's got his freedom, and we're still fighting for ours.'' In the face of unrelenting violence and economic retaliation by the White Citizens Council, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, and other opponents, the MFDP held local caucuses, county assemblies, and a statewide convention (as prescribed by Democratic Party rules) to elect 68 delegates (including four whites) to the 1964 Democratic National Convention scheduled for Atlantic City, New Jersey in August. 1964 Democratic national convention (edit) Aaron Henry reading from a document while seated before the Credentials Committee The MFDP sent its elected delegates by bus to the convention. They challenged the right of the Mississippi Democratic Party's delegation to participate in the convention, claiming that the regulars had been illegally elected in a completely segregated process that violated both party regulations and federal law, and that the regulars had no intention of supporting Lyndon B. Johnson, the party's presidential candidate, in the November election. They asked that the MFDP delegates be seated rather than the segregationist regulars. Some of the original members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation in 1964 were: Lawrence Guyot, Peggy J. Conner, Victoria Gray, Edwin King, Aaron Henry, Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, and Robert Parris Moses. Dr. Martin Luther King told President Johnson that he would ``Do everything in my power to urge (The MFDP) being seated as the only democratically constituted delegation from Mississippi.'' King also voiced his support to Congress, ``I pledge myself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the fullest support of the challenges of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party and call upon all Americans to join with me in this commitment.'' The Democratic Party referred the challenge to the Convention Credentials Committee. The MFDP delegates lobbied and argued their case, and large groups of supporters and volunteers established an around-the-clock picket line on the boardwalk just outside the convention. Their actions attracted considerable publicity. The Credentials Committee televised its proceedings, which allowed the nation to see and hear the testimony of the MFDP delegates, particularly the testimony of Fannie Lou Hamer. She gave a moving and evocative portrayal of her hard brutalized life as a sharecropper on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta and the retaliation inflicted on her for trying to register to vote. After that, most knowledgeable observers thought the majority of the delegates were ready to unseat the regulars and seat the MFDP delegates in their place. But some of the all-white delegations from other southern states threatened to leave the convention and bolt the party (as they had done in previous years) if the regular Mississippi delegation was unseated. President Johnson had wanted a convention stressing unity and feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign against Republican Party candidate Barry Goldwater. To ensure his victory in November, Johnson maneuvered to prevent the MFDP from replacing the regulars. After a frantic scramble, he ordered the chairman of the Credentials Committee to avoid deciding the matter or sending the issue to the convention. With the help of Senator Hubert Humphrey (a potential candidate for vice president) and Party leader Walter Mondale, Johnson engineered a ``compromise'' in which the national Democratic Party offered the MFDP two at-large seats, rather than replacing the regular Democratic delegates from their state. This allowed them to watch the floor proceedings but not take part. The MFDP refused this ``compromise,'' which permitted the white-only regulars, who had not been democratically elected, to keep their seats and denied votes to the MFDP. MFDP leader and Mississippi NAACP President Aaron Henry stated: ``Now, Lyndon made the typical white man's mistake: Not only did he say, 'You've got two votes, 'which was too little, but he told us to whom the two votes would go. He'd give me one and Ed King one; that would satisfy. But, you see, he didn't realize that sixty-four of us came up from Mississippi on a Greyhound bus, eating cheese and crackers and bologna all the way there; we didn't have no money. Suffering the same way. We got to Atlantic City; we put up in a little hotel, three or four of us in a bed, four or five of us on the floor. You know, we suffered a common kind of experience, the whole thing. But now, what kind of fool am I, or what kind of fool would Ed have been, to accept gratuities for ourselves? You say, Ed and Aaron can get in but the other sixty-two can't. This is typical white man picking black folks 'leaders, and that day is just gone.'' The MFDP left the Convention rather than be compromised by accepting the two seats. President Johnson had tried to prevent Fannie Lou Hamer from making her speech. After the United States heard her speech, different parts of the population were outraged and began calling into the White House seeking justice for African Americans in the South. The next year President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to oversee elections at the state and local level, and enforce practices that would support legitimate voter registration and voting in areas with an historic under-representation of certain parts of the population. Fannie Lou Hamer said, ``We didn't come all this way for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired.'' Although denied official recognition, the MFDP kept up their agitation within the Convention. When all but three of the regular Mississippi delegates left because they refused to support Johnson against Goldwater, the Republican Party candidate, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic northern delegates and took the vacated seats. The national Party would not allow them to stay. The next day the MFDP delegates returned to discover that convention organizers had removed the empty seats; they stayed to sing freedom songs. Johnson lost Mississippi in the 1964 presidential election, as whites had still suppressed the black vote. White Democratics were becoming more conservative and voted for Goldwater. With the exception of the 1976 presidential election, when favorite son Jimmy Carter of Georgia was the Democratic candidate, Mississippi has never voted for the Democratic presidential candidate since. Aftermath (edit) The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP. For a while, it became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited Malcolm X to speak and opposed the war in Vietnam. For the better part of a year after hosting the statewide mock election in November 1964, most of the organization's efforts went into challenging the seating of the elected congresspersons of Mississippi to the U.S. House of Representatives. They argued to Congress that, because of the state's disfranchisement, half of the electorate was prevented from participating in the election of those representatives. The FDP had 149 votes in Congress supporting its position; however, the House leadership (dominated by senior Southern Democrats) and Johnson's White House were appalled at this idea and rejected overturning the Democratic representatives from Mississippi. Many Civil Rights Movement activists felt betrayed by Johnson, Humphrey, and the liberal establishment. The movement had been promised that if it concentrated on voter registration rather than protests, it would be supported by the Federal government and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Instead, at the decisive moment, they believed that black civil rights and justice had been sacrificed for the political interests of white politicians. As SNCC Chairman John Lewis later wrote: As far as I'm concerned, this was the turning point of the civil rights movement. I'm absolutely convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to the very center of the system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face. Though the MFDP failed to unseat the regulars at the convention, they did succeed in publicizing the violence and injustice by which the white power structure governed Mississippi and disenfranchised black citizens. The dramatic elements of the MFDP and its convention challenge eventually helped gain Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The MFDP actions resulted in the national party adopting new policy. Its Credentials Committee banned seating delegations that had been chosen through racial discrimination. The MFDP continued as an alternate for several years as African Americans began to register and vote in the regular political system. Many of the people associated with it continued to press to implement civil rights in Mississippi. After passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of registered black voters in Mississippi grew dramatically. The regular party stopped discriminating against blacks and agreed to conform to the Democratic Party rules guaranteeing fair participation. Eventually, the MFDP merged into the regular party and many MFDP activists became party leaders. The FDP has only one active chapter, in Holmes County. After the MFDP was disbanded, many formed a new party, the Loyal Democrats of Mississippi. In 1968, they were successful at the DNC in being seated as the only delegation from Mississippi. Several of these delegates were members of the MFDP.

Rea also wrote the words and composed the music of the song, which appears on his 1978 debut album, Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?. The single's charting success in the USA earned him a Grammy nomination as Best New Artist in 1979. Contents (hide) 1 Background 2 Chart performance (Chris Rea) 3 Covers 3.1 Elkie Brooks version 3.2 Other versions 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Background (edit) ``Fool (If You Think It's Over)'' was the lead single from Rea's debut album Whatever Happened to Benny Santini? which was recorded at producer Gus Dudgeon's Thames Valley recording studio The Mill. The song's inspiration was the experience Rea's younger sister Paula had had some years previously of being devastated at losing her first boyfriend, ``Fool...'''s lyrics being the advice (real or imagined) with which Rea had responded to his sister's experience. Rea would recall that he had written ``Fool...'' as a song which Al Green might record: (quote:) ``I'd always seen it as a Memphis (soul) song (but) I never had the chance to voice my opinion about what I thought about the production'' of his own recording of the song of which Rea has elsewhere stated: ``(It was in the) wrong key. It ended up being this huge California thing (see California Sound). It's the only track I never played guitar on which tells you something about the spirit of it. On top of that, it was just a huge hit. So there was nothing I could do. It was like: 'This is not me! ''' Rea did play keyboards on ``Fool...'' with the track's background vocals provided by Read and the Mill's assistant engineer Stuart Epps. Unsuccessful in its initial UK single release in March 1978, ``Fool...'' was afforded a June 1978 release in the US where it entered the Top 40 of the Hot 100 singles chart in Billboard magazine in July 1978 to reach a# 12 peak on the Hot 100 dated 16 September 1978, then being in the second week of a three-week tenure at# 1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. On the strength its US success Rea was invited to perform ``Fool...'' on the 28 September 1978 TOTP broadcast which evidently facilitated a belated UK chart run for the single with a 28 October 1978 peak of# 30. The considerable success of ``Fool...'' particularly in the US was evidently lost on Rea who recalls being dejected during the 1978 Yuletide overnight drive home from London which inspired ``Driving Home for Christmas'', at the time considering abandoning what he saw as his failing singing career to fall back on his family's established business of running a restaurant. However, when Rea and his wife Joan reached their Middlesbrough home in the early morning ``we opened the door of the house we were just about to lose the mortgage on, and the snow fell into the hall and it didn't melt-it was that cold-and there was one letter on the floor''-the letter in fact accompanied by a substantial royalty cheque generated by ``Fool...''. Rea would remake ``Fool (If You Think It's Over)'' for his 1988 self-produced album New Light Through Old Windows, and this version of ``Fool...'' would have a Dutch single release charting at# 90. In 2007 Rea would again remake ``Fool...'' in a session at The Mill-now known as Sol Studios-where the original had been recorded: Rea produced and played all instruments on the track which was included on his 2008 European CD release Fool If You Think It's Over (The Definitive Greatest Hits). The music journalist Wayne Jacik mentioned the single in his work Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders.

Brooks 'version was one of eight tracks recorded with Dudgeon in 1980 for her 1981 twelve-track album release Pearls which also included four of Brooks 'previous hit singles: Brooks (quote)-``Most of (Pearl's new) material had been chosen by (A&M exec) Derek Green or Gus Dudgeon. I had insisted that we did (sic) 'Fool... '. Chris Rea has always been one of my favourite musicians and writers and I thought the song was pure class.'' Brooks 'version of ``Fool...'' was issued as a single in December 1981 when Pearls issued the previous month was in the Top Ten of the UK album chart-three advance singles had been issued off the album since July 1980 without charting-with ``Fool...'' rising to a# 17 peak on the UK chart dated 27 February 1982 assisted by two TOTP performances by Brooks one of which wasre-run. (After taping her 11 February 1982 TOTP performance of ``Fool...'', Brooks was approached backstage by a fan asking for her autograph who Brooks soon intuited was in fact Chris Rea incognito.) In Ireland ``Fool...'' became Brooks 'highest-charting single with a# 6 chart peak. In a 2014pre-concert interview Brooks, when asked what ``big numbers'' she looked forward to singing, replied: ``I still really like 'Don't Cry Out Loud ', 'Sunshine After the Rain 'and of course 'Fool If You Think It's Over ': that is a terrific song.'' ``Fool If You Think It's Over'' by Elkie Brooks was the first track played on Radio Caroline when the station resumed broadcasting at 10 am 20 August 1983 after a down period of 41 months. Other versions (edit) Thomas Anders remade ``Fool (If You Think It's Over)'' for his 1989 album release Different, said version being the third produced by Gus Dudgeon. The song has also been recorded by Dave (as ``Le palmier du pauvre'', 1978), Kirka (as ``Luulitko kaiken menneen'', 1979), Greger (fi) (as ``Luulitko kaiken menneen''-album Greger, 1980) and Paul Nicholas (album Just Good Friends, 1986). The song served as the theme to the 1990s British sitcom Joking Apart. Kenny Craddock arranged and performed this version.

It first aired on May 17, 2001 as the finale of season seven. It is usually broadcast in a one-hour slot and presented on DVD as one complete episode, but when the episodes are split the two parts are differentiated by the suffixes Part 1 and Part 2. For his guest appearance, Gary Oldman was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Contents (hide) 1 Plot 1.1 Part One 1.2 Part Two 2 Production 3 Reception 4 References 5 External links Plot (edit) Part one (edit) Monica is making a list of things which are most likely to go wrong which seems to be all Rachel's chores when suddenly Joey appears telling them that he got a part in the movie which he wanted, which is related to World War I. At the studios, Joey has started shooting with Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey. When he can't stand it anymore, he talks to Richard about it, when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines. Therefore, when they shoot the next scene, Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines. When their scenes are over for the day, Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day. However, Joey can't come the next day since he is performing Monica and Chandler's wedding. Because he's still in the mood of saying the lines, he accidentally spits on the man who gave him the lines, while telling him that he has important plans due to which he can't come. Back at Monica's apartment, Chandler and Monica are going to their wedding rehearsal. Chandler listens to the answering machine after Monica leaves, when he realizes they're becoming ``The Bings''. At the rehearsal things are going smoothly until Chandler's parents come and things go crazy. When Chandler's mom, Nora Tyler-Bing (played by Morgan Fairchild), is introduced to Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller, Jack embarrasses himself by asking her ``so... are you Chandler's mom or dad?'' Chandler's mom and Chandler's dad, Charles Bing (played by Kathleen Turner), keep having arguments. As a consequence, Rachel is told by Monica to keep them away from each other. Since Rachel doesn't know what Chandler's dad looks like, Monica describes him, saying ``a man in the black dress''. When Rachel looks around, she spots a woman in a black dress having a drink nearby, and assumes that she is Chandler's dad. When both of them introduce themselves, the woman says her name is Amanda and Rachel replies ``Oh, I get it-a-man-duh!'', embarrassing herself. When they return to their apartments, Rachel, Phoebe and Monica are sitting down at the table in Monica's apartment. Monica gets up, walks to her wedding dress and asks Rachel and Phoebe if anyone wanted to be in charge of looking after the dress. Rachel volunteers, but Monica ignores her since she obviously thinks Rachel is irresponsible from results in the past. Rachel is hurt when she volunteers twice and Monica doesn't give her the responsibility. She states that she can be responsible, leading Monica to feel as if she's misjudging her. She apologizes to Rachel and hands over the responsibility to her. Ross continues with his search for Chandler and goes to Rachel's room. As he isn't there, Ross heads towards the door. However, a yellow piece of paper next to the phone catches his eye. When he unfolds it, he finds a note from Chandler saying ``tell Monica I'm sorry''. Ross immediately goes across the hall to Monica's apartment-Rachel opens the door when Monica is in her bedroom, and Ross explains the situation to her. A little while later, Phoebe arrives at the door to find out what's going on and when Rachel just hands over the note without explaining the situation, Phoebe assumes Ross wrote it and tells him to tell Monica himself that he's sorry. Ross goes out to search for Chandler but unfortunately fails. The next morning, Ross arrives at Monica's apartment and informs Rachel and Phoebe that he still hasn't found Chandler. When he leaves, Monica comes out of her room in excitement and starts getting ready. Seeing that Chandler still isn't found and Monica's so excited and thrilled about her wedding day, Rachel starts to panic and eventually cries. Therefore, Phoebe takes her to the bathroom because Monica can't see her in this state or she will know something's wrong. When they're in there, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in the garbage and deduces that Monica is pregnant. Part two (edit) Ross tells Rachel to stall Monica so he can have more time to search for Chandler and Phoebe helps him search. When Monica comes back out of her room to begin getting ready for the wedding, Rachel distracts her by saying ``I'm never gon na get married'' and started to cry. Meanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find a confused Chandler in his office. Ross convinces Chandler to go back to the apartment and begin getting ready, doing one thing at a time, not thinking about the goal. In Monica's apartment, Rachel tries other less believable tactics to distract Monica and she realizes that something is going on. Rachel decides to tell Monica, and starts saying ``We can't find Chandler...''. At this point, Phoebe opens the door and gives a thumbs-up sign to Rachel, who suddenly changes the subject ``Chandler...'s vest'', controlling the situation. At the studios, Joey is stuck shooting an easy scene over and over since Richard is drunk and can barely stay focused. The director made it very clear to Joey that he can't leave until the scenes are finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious, so Joey convinces a confused Richard that they've completed all of their scenes and sends him home. At the hotel, everything is ready for the wedding when Joey calls Rachel to warn her that he'll be late. Meanwhile, Ross is keeping an eye on Chandler since he still has cold feet. Chandler steps out to sneak a cigarette when he suddenly hears Phoebe and Rachel coming, so he ducks into a storeroom to hide. He overhears that Monica's pregnant and takes off again. Rachel finds another wedding finishing up in the same hotel and convinces the minister to officiate the wedding in case Joey doesn't arrive in time. Meanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find Chandler again, who admits that he was indeed running away until he found a small baby outfit in the hotel's gift store and realized that someone that small can't be scary. He then goes with Phoebe and Ross to the wedding. As the ceremony begins, Joey finally arrives and takes his place between Monica and Chandler, accidentally letting slip that Chandler had second thoughts about the wedding. Monica delivers her self-written vow, while Chandler delivers one from the heart-both speeches are very moving. When the ceremony is over Chandler tells Monica that he knows about her being pregnant and how Phoebe told him she found a pregnancy test in the trash, but she reveals she didn't take a pregnancy test. Phoebe then turns to Rachel and says ``And they're going to have a baby!'' Rachel replies in tears, ``Uh huh...'' The camera then zooms in on Rachel showing her looking worried and very emotional, leaving the audience with the knowledge that it is in fact she who's pregnant. Production (edit) The show was filmed over two weeks, with all of the scenes featuring Gary Oldman being filmed in the first week. The wedding was filmed in the second week, with the final shot of Rachel filmed after the studio audience had left. Reception (edit) The first part has a 9.1 rating at TV.com with the second having a slightly higher 9.3. Gary Oldman received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Richard Crosby.

It also hasco-operation agreements with other states: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Morocco, Romania and Slovakia. The Centre employs about 280 staff, mostly appointed from across the member states andco-operating states. The Centre is considering an offer from the Italian Government to move ECMWF's data centre to Bologna, Italy. The new site, a former tobacco factory, would be redesigned by the architecture firm gmp.

Its products are provided to the national weather services of its member states andco-operating states as a complement to their national short-range and climatological activities, and those national states use ECMWF's products for their own national duties, in particular to give early warning of potentially damaging severe weather. ECMWF's core mission is to: Produce numerical weather forecasts and monitor planetary systems that influence weather Carry out scientific and technical research to improve forecast skill Maintain an archive of meteorological data To deliver this core mission, the Centre provides: Twice-daily global numerical weather forecasts Air quality analysis Atmospheric composition monitoring Climate monitoring Ocean circulation analysis Hydrological prediction The Centre develops and operates global atmospheric models and data assimilation systems for the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the Earth's atmosphere and for interacting parts of the Earth-system. It uses numerical weather prediction methods to prepare forecasts and their initial conditions, and it contributes to monitoring the relevant parts of the Earth system. Work and projects (edit) Forecasting (edit) Numerical weather prediction (NWP) requires input of meteorological data, collected by satellites and earth observation systems such as automatic and manned stations, aircraft, ships and weather balloons. Assimilation of this data is used to produce an initial state of a computer model of the atmosphere, from which an atmospheric model is used to forecast the weather. These forecasts are typically: medium-range forecasts, predicting the weather up to 15 days ahead monthly forecasts, predicting the weather on a weekly basis 30 days ahead seasonal forecasts up to 12 months ahead. Over the past three decades ECMWF's wide-ranging programme of research has played a major role in developing such assimilation and modelling systems. This improves the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting by about a day per decade, so that a seven-day forecast now (2015) is as accurate as a three-day forecast was four decades ago (1975). Monthly and seasonal forecasts (edit) ECMWF's monthly and seasonal forecasts provide early predictions of events such as heat waves, cold spells and droughts, as well as their impacts on sectors such as agriculture, energy and health. Since ECMWF runs a wave model, there are also predictions of coastal waves and storm surges in European waters which can be used to provide warnings. Early warning of severe weather events (edit) Forecasts of severe weather events allow appropriate mitigating action to be taken and contingency plans to be put into place by the authorities and the public. The increased time gained by issuing accurate warnings can save lives, for instance by evacuating people from a storm surge area. Authorities and businesses can plan to maintain services around threats such as high winds, floods or snow. In October 2012 the ECMWF model suggested seven days in advance that Hurricane Sandy was likely to make landfall on the East Coast of the United States. It also predicted the intensity and track of the November 2012nor'easter, which impacted the east coast a week after Sandy. ECMWF's Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) was developed as a tool to identify where the EPS forecast distribution differs substantially from that of the model climate. It contains information regarding variability of weather parameters, in location and time and can highlight an abnormality of a weather situation without having to define specific space-and time-dependent thresholds. Satellite data (edit) This section contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information. Please remove or replace such wording and instead of making proclamations about a subject's importance, use facts and attribution to demonstrate that importance. (February 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) ECMWF, through its partnerships with EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU and the European Science community has established a leading position for Europe in the exploitation of satellite data for operational numerical weather prediction, and for operational seasonal forecasting with coupled atmosphere-ocean-land models. The increasing amount of satellite data and the development of more sophisticated ways of extraction information from that data have made a major contribution to improving the accuracy and utility of NWP forecasts. ECMWF continuously endeavours to improve the use of satellite observations for NWP. Reanalysis (edit) This section contains wording that promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information. Please remove or replace such wording and instead of making proclamations about a subject's importance, use facts and attribution to demonstrate that importance. (February 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) ECMWF makes significant contributions to support research on climate variability, pioneering an approach known as reanalysis. This involves feeding weather observations collected over decades into a NWP system to recreate past atmospheric, sea-and land-surface conditions over specific time periods to obtain a clearer picture of how the climate has changed. Reanalysis provides a four-dimensional picture of the atmosphere and effectively allows monitoring of the variability and change of global climate, thereby contributing also to the understanding and attribution of climate change. To date, and with support from Europe's National Meteorological Services and the European Commission, ECMWF has conducted two major reanalyses of the global atmosphere: the first ECMWFre-analysis (ERA-15) project generated reanalyses from December 1978 to February 1994; the ERA-40 project generated reanalyses from September 1957 to August 2002. Operational forecast model (edit) Main article: Integrated Forecast System ECMWF's operational forecasts are produced from its ``Integrated Forecast System'' (sometimes informally known in the United States as the ``European model'') which is run every twelve hours and forecasts out to ten days. It includes both in a ``deterministic forecast'' mode and as an ensemble. The deterministic forecast is a single model run that is relatively high in both resolution but also in computational expense. The ensemble is relatively low (about half that of the deterministic) in resolution and so in computational expense, so less accurate. But it is run 51 times in parallel, from slightly different initial conditions to give a spread of likelihood over the range of the forecast.

With an estimated 2016 population of8,537,673 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term New York minute. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world. Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs--Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island--were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the world's largest foreign-born population of any city. By 2016 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), 20.2 million residents, and the Combined Statistical Area (CSA), 23.7 million residents. In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion. In 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion. NYC's MSA and CSA GDP are higher than the GDPs of all but 11 and 12 countries, respectively. New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, and as a world symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record 61 million tourists in 2016, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's ``heart'' and its ``Crossroads'', is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24/ 7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 472 stations in operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.

James had been named by his older brother Charles II as proprietor of the former territory of New Netherlands and its main city of New Amsterdam, which had recently been seized from the Dutch. Early History During the Wisconsinan glaciation, the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over1,000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today. Later on, movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation of what are now Long Island and Staten Island. In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by various bands of Algonquian tribes of Native Americans, including the Lenape, whose homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island; the western portion of Long Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; the Bronx; and the Lower Hudson Valley. The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown, who sailed his ship La Dauphine into New York Harbor. He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoul\u00eame (New Angoul\u00eame). Peter Minuit is credited with the purchase of the island of Manhattan in 1626. A Spanish expedition led by captain Est\u00eav\u00e3o Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel La Anunciada and charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named R\u00edo de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to Spain in August. The Padr\u00f3n Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show North America's east coast continuously, was informed by Gomes 'expedition and labeled the Northeastern U.S. as Tierra de Esteban G\u00f3mez in his honor. In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered the region when he sailed his ship the Halve Maen (``Half Moon'' in Dutch) into New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as ``a very good Harbour for all windes'' and the river as ``a mile broad'' and ``full of fish.'' Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north, past the site of the present-day Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland). The firstnon-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613--1614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor. New Amsterdam, centered in the eventual Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it ``New York''. Dutch rule A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624--making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States--with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam). The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band, for 60 guilders (about$1,000 in 2006). A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for$24 worth of glass beads. Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly. To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (``patroons'', or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swathes of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success. Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639--1640, in an effort to bolster economy growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies). In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Amsterdam grew from2,000 to8,000. Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship. The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam. English rule In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops led by Colonel Richard Nicolls without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom. The English promptly renamed the fledgling city ``New York'' after the Duke of York (the future King James II of England). The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War. On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from England at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it ``New Orange'' after William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674. Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670. By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200. New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone. New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years. The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America. In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan. American Revolution The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolution, took place in Brooklyn in 1776. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean. The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church. In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States. Nineteenth century Broadway follows the Native American Wickquasgeck Trail through Manhattan. Under New York State's gradual abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until theirmid-to-late twenties. Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children. It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than16,000 in 1840. In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European immigration. The city adopted the Commissioners 'Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes. Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants. Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city. Manhattan's Little Italy, Lower East Side, circa 1900. The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants. Over200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population. There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860. Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861--1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a$300 (equivalent to$5,835 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history. Modern History A construction worker on top of the Empire State Building as it was being built in 1930. The Chrysler Building is below and behind him. In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens. The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing1,021 people on board. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies 'Garment Workers 'Union and major improvements in factory safety standards. UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in front of the United Nations Headquarters building, completed in 1952 New York'snon-white population was36,620 in 1890. New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline. New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history. The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance. Returning World War II veterans created apost-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Monument, as the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States. In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census. United Airlines Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the original World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area. The North Tower was subsequently the tallest building ever to be destroyed and still is. The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Center, and a 9/ 11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center PATH station, which opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attack. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An800,000-square-foot (74,000 m) permanent station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016. The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of American independence. The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide. Geography Main articles: Geography of New York City and Geography of New York Harbor Satellite imagery illustrating the core of the New York City Metropolitan Area, with Manhattan Island at its center New York City is situated in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River--a tidal strait--flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city. The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan. The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km) of land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km) of this is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.

Architecture Further information: Architecture of New York City and List of tallest buildings in New York City Modernist architecture juxtaposed with classical architecture is seen often in New York City. The Chrysler Building, above, built in 1930, is an example of the Art Deco style, with ornamental hub caps and a spire. The Empire State Building is a solitary icon of New York. It was the world's tallest building 1931--70 and is defined by its setbacks, Art Deco details and the spire. Landmark 19th-century rowhouses, including brownstones, on tree-lined Kent Street in the Greenpoint Historic District, Brooklyn. New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the saltbox style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost. Manhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of 2011, New York City had5,937 high-rise buildings, of which 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100 m) high, both second in the world after Hong Kong, with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200 m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world's tallest building. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style. A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its fa\u00e7ade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond\u00e9 Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design. The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian. Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights. According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a ``slightly lower hazard for tall buildings'' in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.

If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten island would be ranked 37th); these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States (New York (Manhattan), Kings (Brooklyn), Bronx, and Queens). Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough, is home to Central Park and most of the city's skyscrapers, and may be locally known simply as The City. Manhattan's (New York County's) population density of72,033 people per square mile (27,812/ km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Manhattan is the cultural, administrative, and financial center of New York City and contains the headquarters of many major multinational corporations, the United Nations Headquarters, Wall Street, and a number of important universities. Manhattan is often described as the financial and cultural center of the world. Most of the borough is situated on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson River. Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan, including Randall's Island, Wards Island, and Roosevelt Island in the East River, and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor. Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Lower, Midtown, and Uptown regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, and above the park is Harlem. The borough also includes a small neighborhood on the United States mainland, called Marble Hill, which is contiguous with The Bronx. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the outer boroughs. Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country. Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn. Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and of postmodern art and design. Queens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States, and the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.) Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the free Staten Island Ferry, a daily commuter ferry which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately2,500 acres (10 km), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city. Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks. The Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough with a majority of it a part of the mainland United States. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball park of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States,Co-op City. It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo, which spans 265 acres (1.07 km) and houses over6,000 animals. The Bronx is also the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at2,765 acres (1,119 ha). Climate Avenue C in Manhattan after flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012. Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, using the 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization. The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa). The city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, and averages 57% of possible sunshine annually, accumulating2,535 hours of sunshine per annum. The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone. Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6\u00b0 F (0.3\u00b0 C); temperatures usually drop to 10\u00b0 F (\u2212 12\u00b0 C) several times per winter, and reach 60\u00b0 F (16\u00b0 C) several days in the coldest winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5\u00b0 F (24.7\u00b0 C) in July. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90\u00b0 F (32\u00b0 C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C). Extreme temperatures have ranged from\u2212 15\u00b0 F (\u2212 26\u00b0 C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106\u00b0 F (41\u00b0 C) on July 9, 1936. The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7\u00b0 F (4.3\u00b0 C) in February to 74.1\u00b0 F (23.4\u00b0 C) in August. The city receives 49.9 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches (66 cm); this varies considerably from year to year. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area, but they are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

The City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, the Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the second best park system among the 50 most populous US cities, behind the park system of Minneapolis. ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per10,000 residents. National Parks Main article: National Park Service The Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island in New York Harbor is a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity. Gateway National Recreation Area contains over26,000 acres (10,521.83 ha) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City, including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over9,000 acres (36 km) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historicpre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina. The Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (``Grant's Tomb''); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst of the modern gay rights movement. State Parks Main article: New York State Parks There are seven state parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (110,000 m) facility that rises 69 feet (21 m) over the Hudson River. City Parks Reindeer at the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo. See also: Parks and recreation in New York City New York City has over28,000 acres (110 km) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23 km) of public beaches. The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with2,765 acres (1,119 ha). Central Park, an 883-acre (3.57 km) park in middle-upper Manhattan, is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most filmed locations in the world, with 40 million visitors in 2013. The park contains a myriad of attractions; there are several lakes and ponds, two ice-skating rinks, the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, and the 106-acre (0.43 km) Jackie Onassis Reservoir. Indoor attractions include Belvedere Castle with its nature center, the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, and the historic Carousel. On October 23, 2012, hedge fund manager John A. Paulson announced a$100 million gift to the Central Park Conservancy, the largest ever monetary donation to New York City's park system. Washington Square Park is a prominent landmark in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. The Washington Square Arch at the northern gateway to the park is an iconic symbol of both New York University and Greenwich Village. Prospect Park in Brooklyn has a 90-acre (360,000 m) meadow, a lake, and extensive woodlands. Within the park is the historic Battle Pass, prominent in the Battle of Long Island. Flushing Meadows--Corona Park in Queens, with its 897 acres (363 ha) making it the city's fourth largest park, was the setting for the 1939 World's Fair and the 1964 World's Fair and is host to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and the annual United States Open Tennis Championships tournament. Over a fifth of the Bronx's area,7,000 acres (28 km), is given over to open space and parks, including Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx Zoo, and the New York Botanical Gardens. In Staten Island, the Conference House Park contains the historic Conference House, site of the only attempt of a peaceful resolution to the American Revolution which was conducted in September 1775, attended by Benjamin Franklin representing the Americans and Lord Howe representing the British Crown. The historic Burial Ridge, the largest Native American burial ground within New York City, is within the park. Central Park, as seen from Rockefeller Center, is the most visited city park in the United States. Military Installations New York City is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city. Established in 1825 in Brooklyn on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, it is one of America's longest serving military forts. Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens.

Source: U.S. Decennial Census New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated record high of8,537,673 residents as of 2016, incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census. More than twice as many people live in New York City as in thesecond-most populous U.S. city (Los Angeles), and within a smaller area. New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city. New York City's population is about 43% of New York State's population and about 36% of the population of the New York metropolitan area. Population density In 2015, the city had an estimated population density of28,053 people per square mile (10,756/ km2), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities housing over100,000 residents in the United States, with several small cities (of fewer than100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 Census. Geographicallyco-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2015 population density of69,468 inhabitants per square mile (26,822/ km) makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city. Race and ethnicity Further information: Chinese in New York City, Fuzhounese in New York City, Indians in New York City, Koreans in New York City, Filipinos in New York City, Bangladeshis in New York City, Japanese in New York City, Russians in New York City, Ukrainians in New York City, Irish in New York City, Italians in New York City, Caribbeans in New York City, and Puerto Ricans in New York City The city's population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3%non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23%non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian. Hispanics of any race represented 28.6% of the population, while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; thenon-Hispanic white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined over a decade. Clockwise, from upper left: the Manhattan Chinatown; Manhattan's Little Italy; Spanish Harlem; and Manhattan's Koreatown Throughout its history, the city has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States; more than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term ``melting pot'' was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city's population. Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants. In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011 were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago, while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over74,000 by 2011. Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Public safety Police and law enforcement Main articles: New York Police Department and Law enforcement in New York City Further information: Crime in New York City The New York City Police Department (NYPD) represents the largest police force in the United States. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been the largest police force in the United States by a significant margin, with over35,000 sworn officers. Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York's Finest. Crime has continued an overall downward trend in New York City since the 1990s. In 2012, the NYPD came under scrutiny for its use of a stop-and-frisk program, which has undergone several policy revisions since then. In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases. By 2002, New York City's crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah, and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than100,000. In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966, and in 2007, the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963. In 2015, 50.5% of New York City misdemeanor assault suspects were black, 33.3% Hispanic, 11.1% white, 4.8% Asian/ Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American. New York City experienced 352 homicides in 2015, its second lowest number on record. Sociologists and criminologists have not reached consensus on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD, including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory. Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes, including from immigration. Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in themid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s. Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city. Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades. The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.

The FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn, and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island. There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/ Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications. The Bronx and Queens offices are in separate buildings. Culture and contemporary Life Further information: Culture of New York City and List of people from New York City New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland and Latvia and by New York's Baruch College. A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940--1965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia. In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, ``Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.'' Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States. The city was a center of jazz in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s. The city's punk and hardcore scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature. The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, disco, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, and jazz in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media. New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor. Arts New York City has more than2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes. The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts. Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as the famed Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that would become internationally established. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. Performing Arts Main articles: Broadway theatre and Music of New York City Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts Broadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that crosses Times Square, also sometimes referred to as ``The Great White Way''. Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan's Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013--2014 season, an 11.4% increase from US$1.139 billion in the 2012--2013 season. Attendance in 2013--2014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012--2013 season's 11.57 million. Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, part of Museum Mile, is one of the largest museums in the world. Visual Arts Main article: List of museums and cultural institutions in New York City New York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation. Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City. Cuisine Main article: Cuisine of New York City Smorgasburg opened in 2011 as an open-air food market and is part of the Brooklyn Flea. New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central European and Italian immigrants brought bagels, cheesecake, and New York-style pizza into the city, while Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous. Some4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to ``nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world'', according to Michelin. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city's24,000 restaurants based upon their inspection results. Clockwise, from upper left: the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the world's largest parade; the annual Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village; the annual Philippine Independence Day Parade; and the ticker-tape parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts Parades New York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world's largest parade, beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy's Herald Square store; the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person. Other notable parades including the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. Accent and dialect Main article: New York City English The New York area has historically been home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English. The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of European descent. The influx ofnon-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect, and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as in the past. The traditional New York area accent is characterized asnon-rhotic, so that the sound (\u0279) does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as ``New Yawk.'' There is no (\u0279) in words like park (p\u0251\u0259k) or (p\u0252\u0259k) (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter (b\u028c\u027e\u0259), or here (hi\u0259). In another feature called the low back chain shift, the (\u0254) vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous (\u0254r) in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like ``girl'' and of words like ``oil'' became a diphthong (\u025c\u026a). This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced ``goil'' and oil is pronounced ``erl''; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like ``Joizey'' (Jersey), ``Toidy-Toid Street'' (33rd St.) and ``terlet'' (toilet). The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family (played by CarrollO'Connor) was an example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade in its overall presence. Sports The New York Marathon is the largest marathon in the world. The US Open Tennis Championships are held every August and September in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. Citi Field, also in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, has been home to the New York Mets since 2009. Main article: Sports in New York City New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer. The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York has been described as the ``Capital of Baseball''. There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore--Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city's two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens, and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. who compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships, while the Mets have won the World Series twice. The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once, and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958. There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones and Staten Island Yankees. The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. The New York Islanders and the New York Rangers represent the city in the National Hockey League. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey Devils, who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey. The city's National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city. The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA. In soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium. The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pel\u00e9. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. The annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens. The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world's largest running marathon, with51,394 finishers in 2016 and98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year. The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the seniorinter-county level. Transportation New York City is home to the two busiest rail stations in the US, including Grand Central Terminal. Main article: Transportation in New York City New York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive. Rapid transit Main article: Mass transit in New York City Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area. Rail The New York City Subway is the world's largest rapid transit system by length of routes and by number of stations. The iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong, London, Paris, Seoul, and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 2015, while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as ``Grand Central Station'', is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms. Public transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit. This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where about 90% of commuters drive automobiles to their workplace. According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities. New York is the only US city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car. Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving$19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans. New York City's commuter rail network is the largest in North America. The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines. In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems. For intercity rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities. The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L ', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro). Multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, the East Side Access project, and the 7 Subway Extension. Buses The Port Authority Bus Terminal, the world's busiest bus station, at 8th Avenue and 42nd Street. New York City's public bus fleet is the largest in North America, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves7,000 buses and200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world. Air John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, the busiest international air passenger gateway to the United States. New York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation. JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011, JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America. Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities. Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton--Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport. Ferries The Staten Island Ferry shuttles commuters between Manhattan and Staten Island. The Staten Island Ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying over 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day. Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. NYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries. Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class. Taxis, transport startups, and trams Other features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass more than12,000 yellow taxicabs; various competing startup transportation network companies; and an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island. Ride-sharing services have become significant competition for cab drivers in New York. Streets and highways 8th Avenue, looking northward (``uptown''). Most streets and avenues in Manhattan's grid plan incorporate a one-way traffic configuration. Despite New York's heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. Manhattan's street grid plan greatly influenced the city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, like Broadway, Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively. New York City also has an extensive web of expressways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to northern New Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic jams that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour. River crossings The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, connects Brooklyn and Staten Island across The Narrows. The George Washington Bridge, connecting Upper Manhattan (background) from Fort Lee, New Jersey across the Hudson River, is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge. New York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors, and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are (primarily) coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and The Bronx is located at the southern tip of New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of well-known bridges and tunnels. The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge, connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest. The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style isneo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism. Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world. The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largestnon-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it. The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn. Environment Main article: Environmental issues in New York City As of July 2010, the city had3,715 hybrid taxis in service, the largest number of any city in North America. Environmental impact reduction New York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint. Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America. New York's high rate of public transit use, over200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014, and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States. Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%. In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States. Citibank sponsored the introduction of10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project in the summer of 2013. Research conducted by Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative. New York City's numerical ``in-season cycling indicator'' of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013. The city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is also a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others. Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive ``Green Buildings'' plan. Water purity and availability Main articles: Food and water in New York City and New York City water supply system New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed. As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants. The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water. The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history, with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020. Environmental revitalization Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities. One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system, and other accumulation. Government and politics Main articles: Government of New York City and Politics of New York City Government New York City Hall is the oldest City Hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions. New York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor--council form of government since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. The Mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries. Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a three consecutive-term limit, which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively. The New York County Courthouse houses the New York Supreme Court and other offices. Each borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System. Uniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different US district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and US Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan. Politics Bill de Blasio, the current and 109th Mayor of New York City The present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993. He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014. The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city. New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry. The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every$1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends$11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also spent an additional$4.1 billion in the 2009--2010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return. Notable people Main article: List of people from New York City Global outreach In 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners.

It is the only U.S. city in which a majority of households do not have a car. Despite this, New York City is very much an American city in the way it under prices and under uses curbside parking meters. Meter rates are far lower than in other leading world cities, and New York suffers from high levels of cruising and double parking (p 62)... Nationally 90% of households own automobiles.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Belting (or vocal belting) is a specific technique of singing by which a singer mixes in the proper proportions, their lower and upper resonances; resulting a sound that resembles yelling but is actually a controlled, sustained phonation. 'Belting 'is sometimes described as 'high chest voice 'but this is technically incorrect and potentially damaging for the voice. It is often described as a vocal register, although this is also technically incorrect; it is rather a descriptive for the use of a register. Singers can use belting to convey heightened emotional states. Contents (hide) 1 Technique 2 Physiology 3 Possible dangers of belting 4 References Technique (edit) ``Chest register'' is the lowest register of the singing voice, produced by dominant use of the thyroarytenoid muscle. The term ``belt'' is sometimes mistakenly described as the use of chest voice in the higher part of the voice. The chest voice is a general term for the sound and muscular functions of the speaking voice, singing in the lower range, and the voice used to shout. Each of those functions requires a thicker closure of the vocal folds and the support of the muscles surrounding them. The term ``chest voice'' is therefore a misunderstanding when it describes muscular work in the chest-area of the body, or a resonance therein. Proper production of the belt voice, according to some vocal methods, involves minimizing tension in the throat and a change of typical placement of the voice sound in the mouth, bringing it forward into the hard palate, although techniques vary by pedagogical style. It is possible to learn classical vocal methods like bel canto and also to be able to belt; in fact, many roles now require it. Vocalists trained in a wide berth of styles describe vastly varying experiences in learning belt technique. Some claim that it comes naturally, while others struggle to access chest register other than while speaking. Style of music does not seem to be a related factor, other than in a singer's exposure to material. Belt technique requires muscle coordination not readily used in classically trained singers as the thyroarytenoid muscle is dominant (as opposed to head register singing where the cricothyroid muscle is dominant), which may be why some opera singers find learning to belt challenging. In order to increase range and stamina, one must practice, however physiology and physical limitations should always be taken into consideration in a realistic approach. Since belting can be harsh on the vocal mechanism if care is not taken, supervision by a teacher experienced in working with belters is recommended in order to avoid developing lifelong pathologies that could be otherwise avoided. Others recommend repeatedly attempting to hit a note in a melody line, or by using vocalise. Many commercial learn-to-sing packages have a set of scales to sing along to as their main offering, with which the purchaser must practice often to see improvement. However, these packages do not offer a user feedback in terms of posture, breath support, muscular constriction, or any assistance with difficulties that a singer may encounter. Since this is not a separate instrument but a part of the human body, care must be taken not to damage it in a way that may later require surgery, so learning to belt without proper supervision is not advised. 'Belters ', as well as other singers, should balance their registers and develop a strong head voice, in order to facilitate muscular coordination and avoid constriction. Some singers, particularly if their chest registers are underdeveloped, find that after a period of time focusing on the belt, the head voice will have improved. Likewise, for a singer with an underdeveloped head register, after a period of time focusing on the head voice, the belt may be found to have improved. Physiology (edit) There are many explanations as to how the belting voice quality is produced. Under a scope, the vocal folds visibly shorten and thicken, and they undulate along more of their vertical surface area than in head register when a smaller segment of their edge must undulate to produce sound. One researcher, Jo Estill, has conducted research on the belting voice, and describes the belting voice as an extremely muscular and physical way of singing. When observing the vocal tract and torso of singers, while belting, Estill observed: Minimal airflow (longer closed phase (70% or greater) than in any other type of phonation) Maximum muscular engagement of the torso (in Estill Voice Training terminology this is known as Torso Control or Anchoring) Engagement of muscles in the head and neck in order to stabilize the larynx) (in Estill Voice Training terminology this is known as Head and Neck Control or Anchoring) A downwards tilt of the cricoid cartilage (an alternative option would be the thyroid tilting backwards. Observations show a larger CT space) High positioning of the larynx Maximum muscular effort of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles, minimum effort at the level of the true vocal folds. Narrowing of the aryepiglottic sphincter (the ``twanger'') Possible dangers of belting (edit) Belting without proper coordination can lead to constriction of the muscles surrounding the vocal mechanism. Constriction can consequently lead to vocal deterioration. Correct use of the technique and, most importantly, retraction of the ventricular folds while singing is vital to safe belting. Without proper training in retraction, belting can indeed cause trauma to the vocal folds that requires the immediate attention of a doctor. Some proponents of belting say that it is a ``soft yell,'' and if produced properly it can be healthy. It does not require straining and they say it is not damaging to the voice. On the other hand, it is thought by some that belting will produce nodules. This may be true if belting is done incorrectly. Many in the musical theater industry like to quip, ``belting is not bad; bad belting is bad.'' As for the physiological and acoustical features of the metallic voices, a master's thesis has drawn the following conclusions: No significant changes in frequency and amplitude of F1 were observed Significant increases in amplitudes of F2, F3 and F4 were found In frequencies for F2, metallic voice perceived as louder was correlated to increase in amplitude of F3 and F4 Vocal tract adjustments like velar lowering, pharyngeal wall narrowing, laryngeal raising, aryepiglottic and lateral laryngeal constriction were frequently found.

Dates June 16--18, 1967 Location (s) Monterey County Fairgrounds, Monterey, California Years active 1967 Founded by Lou Adler, John Phillips, Alan Pariser The Monterey International Pop Music Festival was a three-day concert event held June 16 to June 18, 1967 at the Monterey County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California. Crowd estimates for the festival have ranged from25,000 to90,000 people, who congregated in and around the festival grounds. The fairgrounds 'enclosed performance arena, where the music took place, had an approved festival capacity of7,000, but it was estimated that8,500 jammed into it for Saturday night's show, with many extra attendees standing around the sides of the arena. Festival-goers who wanted to see the musical performances were required to have either an 'all-festival 'ticket or a separate ticket for each of the five scheduled concert events they wanted to attend in the arena: Friday night, Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday afternoon and night. Ticket prices varied by seating area, and ranged from$3 to$6.50 ($22--48 in 2018, adjusted for inflation). The festival is remembered for the first major American appearances by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Who and Ravi Shankar, the first large-scale public performance of Janis Joplin and the introduction of Otis Redding. The Monterey Pop Festival embodied the theme of California as a focal point for the counterculture and is generally regarded as one of the beginnings of the ``Summer of Love'' in 1967; the first rock festival had been held just one week earlier at Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, the KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival. Because Monterey was widely promoted and heavily attended, featured historic performances, and was the subject of a popular theatrical documentary film, it became an inspiration and a template for future music festivals, including the Woodstock Festival two years later.

Monterey and Big Sur had been known as the site for the long-running Monterey Jazz Festival and Big Sur Folk Festival; the promoters saw the Monterey Pop festival as a way to validate rock music as an art form in the way in which jazz and folk were regarded. The organizers succeeded beyond all expectations. The artists performed for free with all revenue donated to charity, except for Ravi Shankar, who was paid$3,000 for his afternoon-long performance on the sitar. Country Joe and the Fish were paid$5,000 not by the festival itself, but from revenue generated from the D.A. Pennebaker documentary. The artists did however have their flights and accommodation paid for. Apart from Shankar, each act was given up to 40 minutes for their performance. Several ended their sets earlier, including the Who, who played for only 25 minutes. Lou Adler later reflected: (O) ur idea for Monterey was to provide the best of everything--sound equipment, sleeping and eating accommodations, transportation--services that had never been provided for the artist before Monterey... We set up an on-site first aid clinic, because we knew there would be a need for medical supervision and that we would encounter drug-related problems. We didn't want people who got themselves into trouble and needed medical attention to go untreated. Nor did we want their problems to ruin or in any way disturb other people or disrupt the music... Our security worked with the Monterey police. The local law enforcement authorities never expected to like the people they came in contact with as much as they did. They never expected the spirit of 'Music, Love and Flowers 'to take over to the point where they'd allow themselves to be festooned with flowers. Monterey's bill boasted a lineup that put established stars like the Mamas and the Papas, Simon& Garfunkel and the Byrds alongside groundbreaking new acts from the UK and the US. The song ``San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)'' was written by Phillips and sung by McKenzie, released in May 1967, to promote the event. Performances (edit) Jefferson Airplane (edit) With two huge singles behind them, Jefferson Airplane was one of the major attractions of the festival, having built up a large following on the West Coast. The who (edit) Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, the Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. The band used rented Vox amps for their set, which were not as powerful as their regular Sound City amps which they had left in England to save shipping costs. At the end of their frenetic performance of ``My Generation'', the audience was stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend smashed his guitar, smoke bombs exploded behind the amps and frightened concert staff rushed onstage to retrieve expensive microphones. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. During Jimi Hendrix 'stay in England he and the Who had seen each other perform, they were both impressed with and intimidated by each other, so neither wanted to be upstaged by the other. They decided to toss a coin, with the Who ending up performing just before Hendrix. Grateful Dead (edit) Michael Lydon, author of Flashbacks (2003) commented: ``The Grateful Dead were beautiful. They did at top volume what Shankar had done softly. They played pure music, some of the best music of the concert. I have never heard anything in music that could be said to be qualitatively better than the performance of the Dead, Sunday night. Jerry Garcia noted: ``(The Who) smashing all their equipment. I mean, they did it so well. It looked so great. It was like, 'Wow, that is beautiful. 'We went on. We played our little music. And it seemed so lame to me, at the time. And (Jimi Hendrix) was also beautiful and incredible and sounded great and looked great. I loved both acts. I sat there gape-jawed. They were wonderful.'' The Jimi Hendrix Experience (edit) Hendrix 'use of extremely high volumes, the feedback this produced, and the combination of the two along with his dive-bombing use of the vibrato bar on his guitar, produced sounds that, with the exception of the British in attendance, none of the audience had ever heard before. This, along with his look, his clothing, and his erotic antics onstage, had an enormous impact on the audience. To take things further, aware of The Who's planned explosive finale, he asked around for a can of lighter fluid, which he placed behind one of his amplifier stacks before beginning his set. He ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of ``Wild Thing'', which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it on fire, and then smashing it onto the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This performance put Hendrix on the map and generated an enormous amount of attention in the music press and newspapers alike. Robert Christgau later wrote in The Village Voice of Hendrix's performance: Music was a given for a Hendrix stuck with topping the Who's guitar-smashing tour de force. It's great sport to watch this outrageous scene-stealer wiggle his tongue, pick with his teeth, and set his axe on fire, but the showboating does distract from the history made that night--the dawning of an instrumental technique so effortlessly fecund and febrile that rock has yet to equal it, though hundreds of metal bands have gotten rich trying. Admittedly, nowhere else will you witness a Hendrix still uncertain of his divinity. Big Brother and the Holding Company (Janis Joplin) (edit) Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and the Holding Company. Joplin gave a provocative rendition of the song ``Ball and Chain''. Columbia Records signed Big Brother and the Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey. Eric Burdon and the Animals (edit) Eric Burdon changed gears with his performance at Monterey. After six years of playing with the original Animals as part of the British Invasion, and the breakup of that band, Eric assembled a new band, a ``New Animals'' and at the festival, they performed the seminal work ``Paint It Black'' which showcased Burdon's new style:anti-war, hard rock. Monterey affected his career intensely, as later captured in the song he wrote about it. Otis Redding (edit) Redding, backed by Booker T.& the MG's, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding's career. Until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding's show, received well by the audience (``there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding's set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend'') included ``Respect'' and a version of ``Satisfaction''. The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died six months later in a plane crash at the age of 26. Ravi Shankar (edit) Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival. The Raga Dhun (Dadra and Fast Teental) (which was later miscredited as ``Raga Bhimpalasi''), an excerpt from Shankar's four-hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, concluded the Monterey Pop film, introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans. The Mamas& the Papas (edit) The Mamas& the Papas closed the festival. They also brought on Scott McKenzie to play his John Phillips-written single ``San Francisco, (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)''. Their set included their biggest hits, ``Monday, Monday'' and ``California Dreamin '''. The song ``Dancing in the Street'', was the final song performed at the festival, with Mama Cass telling the audience ``You're on your own''. Cancellations and no-shows (edit) This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several acts were also notable for theirnon-appearance. The Beach Boys, who had been involved in the conception of the event and were at one point scheduled to headline and close the show, failed to perform. This resulted from a number of issues plaguing the group. Carl Wilson was in a dispute with officials over his refusal to be drafted into military service during the Vietnam War. The group's new, radical album Smile had recently been aborted and remained unreleased, leaving band leader Brian Wilson in a state and unwilling or incapable of performing (he hadn't performed live with the group since late 1964, although he would do so in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1967). Since Smile had not been released, the group felt their older material would not go over well with the audience. The cancellation permanently lowered their reputation and popularity in the US, which would contribute to their replacement album Smiley Smile charting lower than any other of their previous album releases. The Beatles were rumored to appear because of the involvement of their press officer Derek Taylor, but they declined, since their music had become too complex to be performed live. Instead, at the instigation of Paul McCartney, the festival booked The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Over the weekend of the festival, the Beatles were in London, preparing for the 'Our World 'television broadcast. The Kinks were invited but could not get a work visa to enter the US because of a dispute with the American Federation of Musicians. Donovan was refused a visa to enter the United States because of a 1966 drug bust. Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band was also invited to appear but, according to the liner notes for the CD reissue of their album Safe as Milk, the band turned the offer down at the insistence of guitarist Ry Cooder, who felt the group was not ready. However, Cooder has also claimed that at a warm-up show several days before, Beefheart refused to sing and jumped off the stage, leaving the band to play a mostly instrumental set. The guitarist said this was the reason he refused to play. Dionne Warwick and the Impressions were advertised on some of the early posters for the event, but Warwick dropped out because of a conflict in booking that weekend. She was booked at the Fairmont Hotel; the hotel was reluctant to release her and it was thought that cancelling that appearance would negatively affect her career. Bob Dylan did receive an invitation, but he declined due to the fact that he was still recovering from his motorcycle accident the previous year. Hendrix paid tribute to him by covering ``Like a Rolling Stone''. The Mothers of Invention were invited to perform, but their leader Frank Zappa declined because of his refusal to share the stage with any of the San Francisco bands who he felt were inferior. Even though the logo for the band Kaleidoscope is seen in the film as a pink sign just below the stage, the band did not perform at the Monterey Festival. Although the Rolling Stones did not play, guitarist and founder Brian Jones attended and appeared on stage to introduce Hendrix. The group was on the short list of invitees, but was unable to get work visas because of the drug arrests of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It was long rumored that Love had declined an invitation to Woodstock, but Mojo Magazine later confirmed that it was the Monterey Festival they had rejected. The promoters also invited several Motown artists to perform and even were going to give the label's artists their own slot. However, Berry Gordy refused to let any of his acts appear, even though Smokey Robinson was on the board of directors. The Monkees were the biggest-selling musical act in the United States in 1967 and were seriously considered to play, but after weeks of deliberation, John Phillips and Lou Adler decided not to invite them. However, group members Micky Dolenz (in full American Indian buckskins and headdress) and Peter Tork attended the festival and mingled with musicians backstage. Tork was asked to introduce Buffalo Springfield, his favorite group, for their set. Tork also introduced Lou Rawls and was involved in a bizarre incident where he walked out onstage in the middle of the Grateful Dead's set to try to stop fans from climbing on stage and dancing. Tork also informed the crowd that the Beatles were not at the festival in disguise. According to Eric Clapton, Cream did not perform because the band's manager wanted to make a bigger splash for their American debut later that year. However, it has since been revealed that the band were not considered by the festival organizers. The Doors also were not invited, even though they were a successful group by this time. Keyboardist Ray Manzarek later said ``We were quite angry wondering why the Association was at the Monterey Pop Festival, and The Doors were not''. The Rascals were also invited, but according to Gene Cornish the band had already been booked to play another gig that same weekend. Influence (edit) Music writer Rusty DeSoto argues that pop music history tends to downplay the importance of Monterey in favor of the ``bigger, higher-profile, more decadent'' Woodstock Festival, held two years later. But, as he notes: Monterey Pop was a seminal event... featuring debut performances of bands that would shape the history of rock and affect popular culture from that day forward. The County Fairgrounds in Monterey, California... had been home to folk, jazz and blues festivals for many years. But the weekend of June 16--18, 1967 was the first time it was used to showcase rock music. The festival launched the careers of many who played there, making some of them into stars virtually overnight, including Janis Joplin, Laura Nyro, Canned Heat, Otis Redding, Steve Miller, and Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Monterey was also the first high-profile event to mix acts from major regional music centers in the U.S.--San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and New York City--and it was the first time many of these bands had met each other in person. It was a particularly important meeting place for bands from the Bay Area and L.A., who had tended to regard each other with a degree of suspicion--Frank Zappa for one made no secret of his low regard for some of the San Francisco bands--and until that point the two scenes had been developing separately along fairly distinct lines. Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane said ``The idea that San Francisco was heralding was a bit of freedom from oppression.'' Monterey also marked a significant changing of the guard in British music. The Who and Eric Burdon and the Animals represented the UK, with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones conspicuously absent. The Stones 'Brian Jones wafted through the crowd, resplendent in full psychedelic regalia, and appeared on stage briefly to introduce Jimi Hendrix. It would be two more years before the Stones hit the road, by which time Jones was dead, and the Beatles never toured again. Meanwhile, the Who leapt into the breach and became the top British touring act of the period. Also notable was the festival's innovative sound system, designed and built by audio engineer Abe Jacob, who started his career doing live sound for San Francisco bands and went on to become a leading sound designer for the American theater. Jacob's groundbreaking Monterey sound system was the progenitor of all the large-scale PAs that followed. It was a key factor in the festival's success and it was greatly appreciated by the artists--in the Monterey film, David Crosby can clearly be seen saying ``Great sound system!'' to bandmate Chris Hillman at the start of the Byrds 'soundcheck. Lighting by Chip Monck attracted the attention of the Woodstock Festival promoters. Electronic music pioneers Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause set up a booth at Monterey to demonstrate the new electronic music synthesizer developed by Robert Moog. Beaver and Krause had bought one of Moog's first synthesizers in 1966 and had spent a fruitless year trying to get someone in Hollywood interested in using it. Through their demonstration booth at Monterey, they gained the interest of acts including the Doors, the Byrds, the Rolling Stones, Simon& Garfunkel, and others. This quickly built into a steady stream of business, and the eccentric Beaver was soon one of the busiest session men in L.A. He and Krause earned a contract with Warner Brothers. Eric Burdon and the Animals later that same year, in their hit ``Monterey'', quoted a line from the Byrds 'song ``Renaissance Fair'' (``I think that maybe I'm dreamin ''') and mentioned performers the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, Ravi Shankar, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Hugh Masekela, Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones 'Brian Jones (``His Majesty Prince Jones smiled as he moved among the crowd''). The instruments used in the song imitate the styles of these performers. Anniversary festival (edit) The festival did not become an annual event. However, in 2017 on the fiftieth anniversary of the festival, the ``Monterey International Pop Festival--Celebrates 50 Years'' was held at the same venue on the same weekend, with the participation of Lou Adler. Nora Jones, daughter of Ravi Shankar, was one of the headliners. Recording and filming the festival (edit) Main article: Monterey Pop The festival was the subject of a documentary movie entitled Monterey Pop, by noted documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker. Pennebaker's team used recently developed portable 16mm crystal-sync motion picture cameras that stayed synchronized with double-system sound-recording systems. The film stock was Eastman Kodak's recently released ``high-speed'' 16mm Ektachrome 100 ASA color reversal motion picture stock, without which the nighttime shows would have been virtually impossible to shoot in color. Sound was captured by Wally Heider's mobile studio on a then state-of-the art eight-channel recorder, with one track used for the crystal-sync tone, to synchronize it with the film cameras. The Grateful Dead believed that the film was too commercial and refused permission to be shown. The screening of the film in theaters nationwide helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of would-be festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more such festivals around the country. Adler said the cameramen were instructed to capture at least 2 complete songs for most of the acts, but for certain others, particularly The Who and Hendrix, to film as much of the sets as possible. As a result, only one song was not captured in part at least from both act's performances. Big Brother's scheduled set was not filmed due to a disagreement. However, due to the huge reaction the band got, they were asked to return to play two songs on Sunday, to be filmed specifically for the movie. An expanded version of the documentary has been released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection. The audio recordings of the festival eventually became the basis for many albums, most notably the 1970 release Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival featuring partial sets by Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix. Other releases recorded at the festival included dedicated live albums by the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Shankar. In 1992, a four-CD box set was released featuring performances by most of the artists; various other compilations have been released over the years. According to a radio promotional feature that accompanied the box set release, on modified stages, including flatbed Kaleidscope (LA) trucks, set up in the surrounding environs, there had been several spontaneous jam sessions for the overflow crowds and campers. Among them was one at the Monterey Peninsula Community College sports stadium (right across the Hwy. 1 interchange), where Jimi Hendrix, flanked by Jorma Kaukonen and John Cipollina, played for an enthusiastic audience. It was also reported locally that Eric Burdon had checked out the provisions and healthcare facilities. Moby Grape's Monterey recordings and film footage remain unreleased, allegedly because manager Matthew Katz demanded$1 million for the rights.

Cheshire Cat Alice's Adventures in Wonderland character The Cheshire cat as illustrator John Tenniel envisioned it in the 1865 publication Created by Lewis Carroll Information Species Tabby British Shorthair Cat Gender Male (the Queen of Hearts cries ``off with his head'' when the cat upsets the king) Quote ``Most everyone's mad here'' ``You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself'' The Cheshire Cat (/ \u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u0283\u0259r/ or/ \u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u0283\u026a\u0259r/) is a fictional cat popularised by Lewis Carroll in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and known for its distinctive mischievous grin. While most often celebrated in Alice-related contexts, the Cheshire Cat predates the 1865 novel and has transcended the context of literature and become enmeshed in popular culture, appearing in various forms of media, from political cartoons to television, as well ascross-disciplinary studies, from business to science. One of its distinguishing features is that from time to time its body disappears, the last thing visible being its iconic grin. Contents (hide) 1 Origins 2 Lewis Carroll's character 2.1 Source of imagery 3 Adaptions 3.1Cross-film comparison 4 In science 5 Notes 6 References 7 External links Origins (edit) There are numerous theories about the origins of the phrase ``grinning like a Cheshire Cat'' in English history. A possible origin of the phrase is one favoured by the people of Cheshire, a county in England which boasts numerous dairy farms; hence the cats grin because of the abundance of milk and cream. According to Brewer's Dictionary, ``The phrase has never been satisfactorily accounted for, but it has been said that cheese was formerly sold in Cheshire moulded like a cat that looked as though it was grinning''. The cheese was cut from the tail end, so that the last part eaten was the head of the smiling cat. In 1853, Samuel Maunder explained: This phrase owes its origin to the unhappy attempts of a sign painter of that country to represent a lion rampant, which was the crest of an influential family, on the sign-boards of many of the inns. The resemblance of these lions to cats caused them to be generally called by the more ignoble name. A similar case is to be found in the village of Charlton, between Pewsey and Devizes, Wiltshire. A public-house by the roadside is commonly known by the name of The Cat at Charlton. The sign of the house was originally a lion or tiger, or some such animal, the crest of the family of Sir Edward Poore. Its first appearance in literature was in the 18th century. A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue (1788) by Francis Grose (The Second Edition, Corrected and Enlarged, London) contains the following entry: ``CHESHIRE CAT. He grins like a Cheshire cat; said of any one who shows his teeth and gums in laughing.'' The phrase appears again in print in John Wolcot's pseudonymous Peter Pindar's Pair of Lyric Epistles (1792): ``Lo, like a Cheshire cat our court will grin.'' The phrase also appears in print in William Makepeace Thackeray's The Newcomes (1855) (``That woman grins like a Cheshire cat.''). A survey published in 2015 showed how highly fanciful were so many purported explanations seen on the internet. The expression was finally explained as an amalgam of the widely-used phrase 'grinning like a cat that got the (spilt) cream 'which could apply to any part of the country (although Cheshire was thepre-eminent milk, cheese and cream producing county for several centuries) with Cheshire's unique political situation. On their own, either of these would have been something to grin about. Importantly, the county was described as a 'palatinate 'from the 1290s and was promoted to be Principality in 1397 following the support its men gave King Richard II. No other English county has been honoured in this way or was accorded such unusually wide privileges, including its own 'borderland 'laws and taxes, and a considerable measure of independence from national government into the sixteenth century. These privileges attracted many who (in the recent words of an eminent professor of medieval history) 'arrived as fugitives from justice and this seems to have become the principle motivation (for escaping to Cheshire from the Kings laws) as the Middle Ages wore on. 'Once safely across the border into the palatine's jurisdiction, these transgressors could grin cheekily at any pursuing King's Sheriffs-and 'disappear 'into the countryside. Certainly, dictionaries show the word 'caitiff 'derived from Old French or Anglo-Norman in terms such as 'cowardly or base villain 'or 'mean despicable fellow ', and with its diminutive 'cat 'meaning 'a 'sharp 'fellow '-as utilize in today's jazz idioms. Lewis Carroll's character (edit) The Cheshire Cat is now largely identified with the character of the same name in Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Alice first encounters the Cheshire Cat at the Duchess's house in her kitchen, and later on the branches of a tree, where it appears and disappears at will, and engages Alice in amusing but sometimes perplexing conversation. The cat sometimes raises philosophical points that annoy or baffle Alice; but appears to cheer her when it appears suddenly at the Queen of Hearts 'croquet field; and when sentenced to death, baffles everyone by having made its head appear without its body, sparking a debate between the executioner and the King and Queen of Hearts about whether a disembodied head can indeed be beheaded. At one point, the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin, prompting Alice to remark that ``she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat''. According to recent analysis by scholar David Day, Lewis Carroll's cat was Edward Bouverie Pusey, Oxford professor of Hebrew, and Carroll's mentor. A hanging chain forms a catenary. The name Pusey was suggested by Alice's deferential address of the cat as ``Cheshire Puss''. Pusey was an authority on the fathers of the Christian Church, and in Carroll's time Pusey was known as the Patristic Catenary (or chain), after the chain of authority of Church patriarchs. As a mathematician, Carroll would have been well familiar with the other meaning of catenary: the curve of a horizontally-suspended chain, which suggests the shape of the cat's grin. RIDDLE: What kind of a cat can grin? ANSWER: A Catenary.--David Day, Queen's Quarterly (2010) Source of imagery (edit) Grinning Cheshire Cat, St Wilfrid's Church. Grappenhall, Cheshire The cat carving in St Nicolas Church, Cranleigh There are many other suggestions that Carroll found inspiration for the name and expression of the Cheshire Cat in the 16th century sandstone carving of a grinning cat, on the west face of St Wilfrid's Church tower in Grappenhall, a village adjacent to his birthplace in Daresbury, Cheshire. Lewis Carroll's father, Reverend Charles Dodgson, was Rector of Croft and Archdeacon of Richmond in North Yorkshire, England, from 1843 to 1868; Carroll lived here from 1843 to 1850. Historians believe Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat in the book Alice in Wonderland was inspired by a carving in Croft church. A fully mature British Shorthair Another possible inspiration was the British Shorthair: Carroll saw a representative British Shorthair illustrated on a label of Cheshire cheese. The Cat Fanciers 'Association profile reads: ``When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile '''. In 1992, members of the Lewis Carroll Society attributed it to a gargoyle found on a pillar in St Nicolas Church, Cranleigh, where Carroll used to travel frequently when he lived in Guildford (though this is doubtful as he moved to Guildford some three years after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland had been published) and a carving in a church in the village of Croft-on-Tees, in the north east of England, where his father had been rector. Carroll is believed to have visited St. Christopher's church in Pott Shrigley, Cheshire, which has a stone sculpture most closely resembling the pictorial cat in the book. ``St. Christopher's Church, Pott Schrigley History''. Retrieved 2017-10-10. Adaptions (edit) The Cheshire Cat character has beenre-depicted by other creators and used as the inspiration for new characters, primarily in screen media (film, television, video games) and print media (literature, comics, art). Othernon-media contexts that embrace the Cheshire Cat include music, business, and science. A Cheshire cat stuffed toy from The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Prior to 1951 when Walt Disney released an animated adaptation of the story (see below), there were fewpost-Alice allusions to the character. Martin Gardner, author of The Annotated Alice, wondered if T.S. Eliot had the Cheshire Cat in mind when writing Morning at the Window, but notes no other significant allusions in thepre-war period. Images of and references to the Cheshire Cat cropped up with increasing frequency in the 1960s and 1970s, along with more frequent references to Carroll's works in general. (See generally the lyrics to White Rabbit by the rock group Jefferson Airplane). The Cheshire Cat appeared on LSD blotters, as well as in song lyrics and popular fiction. In the 1951 Disney animated film, Alice in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat is depicted as an intelligent and mischievous character that sometimes helps Alice and sometimes gets her into trouble. He frequently sings the first verse of the Jabberwocky poem. The animated character was voiced by Sterling Holloway (Alice in Wonderland) and Jim Cummings (2004--present). In the 1985 television adaptation of Carroll's books, the Cheshire Cat is voiced by Telly Savalas. He sings a morose song called ``There's No Way Home,'' which simply drives Alice to try and find a way home even more. In the 1999 television adaptation of Carroll's books, the Cheshire Cat is voiced by Whoopi Goldberg. She acts as an ally and friend to Alice. The Cheshire Cat appears in Walt Disney's 2010 Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton. British actor Stephen Fry voices the character. In the movie, Cheshire (as he is often called; or sometimes ``Chess'') binds the wound Alice suffered earlier by the Bandersnatch and guides her to Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter and Thackery Earwicket, the March Hare. He is blamed by the Hatter for desertion when the White Queen is deposed by the Red; but later impersonates the Hatter when the latter is sentenced to decapitation. Throughout his appearances, ``Chess'' is able to make himself intangible or weightless, as well as invisible (and thus to survive decapitation), and is usually shown inmid-air, at shoulder-height to human-sized characters. In the video game adaptation of the movie, Chess is a playable character who can not only turn himself invisible, but other objects around him as well.Cross-film comparison (edit) Each major film adaptation of Lewis Carroll's tale represents the Cheshire Cat character and his traits uniquely. Screen Media Adaptation Distribution Medium Cheshire Cat's Appearance Cheshire Cat's Behavior Image Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) Film (Alice in Wonderland, traditional animation by Walt Disney Studios) Thick build and a primarily pink coat with purple stripes. Wide smile and close-set, piercing yellow eyes. Character always depicted in good lighting with strong visibility, unlike other adaptations which obscure or shadow him Mischievous, and takes pleasure in misdirecting Alice. He is able to dislocate his head from his body (does so in jest), but is also capable of invisibility, and frequently enters and exits the scene with all parts faded away except for his grin or eyes. Adventures in Wonderland (1991 TV show) Televised broadcast (Adventures in Wonderland, TV series through 1995) Closer resemblance to a tiger or lioness than a house cat. Coat has a white base with stripes painted in a violet accent color. Form possesses human-like mouth and facial structure A sarcastic and playful rendition of the character. In this adaptation, the Cheshire Cat has the ability to appear and disappear in any location. He is quick to play practical jokes on other the characters in the show. Alice in Wonderland (1999 made-for-TV movie) Television Film A fluffy grey cat with a human face and feline features. A grinning cat who teaches Alice ``the rules'' of Wonderland. Her favorite pastime is appearing and disappearing. Alice in Wonderland (2010 film) Film (Alice in Wonderland, live-action directed by Tim Burton) More slender build, with a round head and grey/ green coat with several blue/ black stripes. Bright aqua eyes (with slit-shaped pupils) and prominent teeth. Often more backlit than other adaptations, with only a faint, luminescent glow (self-generated) bringing his features into view. Disappearing and reappearing at will, and able even to change his size, levitate himself, assume the appearances of other characters, and become intangible at will. The cat plays a few jokes and toys with the other characters, but is helpful on a few occasions. He speaks in a slow and fluid manner. The Cheshire Cat as depicted in American McGee's Alice In addition to the Cheshire Cat's appearances in films central to its Lewis Carroll origins, the Cheshire Cat has been featured in other cinematic works. The late filmmaker Chris Marker gave his monumental documentary on the New Left movement of 1967--1977, Le fond del'air est rouge (1977), the English title Grin Without a Cat. Like the original, it signifies that revolution was in the air, but failed to take root. In the film, it is also stated: a spearhead without a spear, a grin without a catThe Cheshire Cat has been seen by television audiences in a broadcast spin-off. The Cheshire Cat appears in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland (a spin-off of Once Upon a Time) voiced by Keith David. While looking for the Mad Hatter's house from the trees, Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat in giant form where the Red Queen had promised him that Alice would be good food for him. Both of them ended up engaging each other in combat until the Knave of Hearts arrived and threw a piece of one mushroom side into his mouth, which shrank him back to normal size as the Cheshire Cat leaves. The Cheshire Cat appears as an avatar character in several the video games American McGee's Alice (2000); and the sequel Alice: Madness Returns (2011), the Cheshire Cat is portrayed as an enigmatic, yet wise guide for Alice in the corrupted Wonderland. In keeping with the twisted tone of the game, the Cheshire Cat is mangy and emaciated in appearance. His voice was provided by Roger L. Jackson, who also voiced the Mad Hatter and The Jabberwock in the game. In science (edit) Cheshire Cat is used as a metaphor to explain several scientific phenomena: The Cheshire Cat effect, as described by Sally Duensing and Bob Miller, is a binocular rivalry which causes stationary objects seen in one eye to disappear from view when an object in motion crosses in front of the other eye. Each eye sees two different views of the world, sends those images to the visual cortex where they are combined, and creates a three-dimensional image. The Cheshire Cat effect occurs when one eye is fixated on a stationary object, while the other notices something moving. Since one eye is seeing a moving object, the brain will focus on it, causing parts of the stationary object to fade away from vision entirely. In another scientific context, catalytic RNAs have been deemed Cheshire cats. This metaphor is used to describe the fading of the ribonucleotide construct, which leaves behind a smile of only the mineral components of the RNA catalyst. Similarly, the Cheshire Cat has been used out of its traditional context to help define another scientific phenomenon, the ``Cheshire Cat'' escape strategy. When Coccolithophore--a species of successful ocean algae--is able to resist the haploid phase of its life cycle it escapes meiosis and its dominant diploid genes are passed on in a virus-free environment, freeing the host from the danger of infection during reproduction. The algae escape death (beheading) by means of disappearance (vanishing his head):... (T) aken from Lewis Carroll, we liken this theory to the strategy used by the Cheshire Cat in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland of making its body invisible to make the sentence ``off with his head'' pronounced by the Queen of Hearts impossible to execute... CC dynamics, which rely to some extent on separation of the sexual processes of meiosis and fusion in time and/ or space, release the host from short-term pathogen pressure, thus widening the scope for the host to evolve in other directions. Other gestures to the Cheshire Cat's tropes of disappearance and mystique have been seen in scientific literature coming from the field of Physics. ``The Cheshire Cat'' is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics in which a particle and its property behave as if they are separated, or when a particle separates from one of its physical properties. To test this idea, researchers used an interferometer where neutron beams passed through silicon crystal. The crystal physically separated the neutrons and allowed them to go to two paths. Researchers reported ``the system behaves as if the neutrons go through one beam path, while their magnetic moment travels along the other.'' The Cheshire cat's grin has inspired scientists in their naming of visual phenomena. A merger of galaxy groups in the constellation Ursa Major is nicknamed ``Cheshire Cat galaxy group'' by Astronomers due to its suggestive appearance. In linguistics, cheshirization, when a sound disappears but leaves a trace, just like the cat disappears but leaves his grin.

It is a public park, commemorating the song ``Take It Easy'' which was written by Jackson Browne and Glenn Frey and most famously recorded by the Eagles. The song includes the verse ``Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona and such a fine sight to see. It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford slowin 'down to take a look at me.'' The park contains a two-story trompe-l'\u0153il mural by John Pugh, and a bronze statue by Ron Adamson of a life-sized man who is standing on a corner with a guitar by his side. The park is surrounded by a wall of bricks, with windows to peer into; each brick has a donor's name on it, and a story by each of the donors describing their fondness for Winslow, Arizona. History (edit) Until the 1960s, Winslow was a thriving town in northern Arizona just off Route 66. Construction of the$7.7 million bypass around Winslow began soon after 1977. When I-40 bypassed the community many local businesses disappeared, the tourism sector being among the hardest hit. While some local jobs remained (as Winslow is the base of operation for one thousand railroad workers), the local downtown was badly hurt by the influx of national chains (such as Walmart and McDonald's) along the new interstate highway to the north of the town. Twenty years passed and Winslow was stuck in a commercial rut. Winslow was the next to last town to be bypassed... We would watch hundreds of trucks roll by day and night. Then one morning, they opened (I-40) and everything stopped. For about 20 years, nobody knew what to do.--Diane Patterson, Winslow-born owner of Roadworks Gifts and Souvenirs In 1997, the La Posada Hotel (a former Harvey House on the Santa Fe Railroad, long at risk for demolition) was restored and reopened. Listing of La Posada Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places served as a first step towardre-awakening the town. The Standin 'on the Corner Foundation was formed to create a renaissance of Winslow. Determined to build on tourism, the foundation took advantage of the town being mentioned in the song ``Take It Easy'' made famous by the Eagles. From 1997 until 1999, the foundation was busy finding donors and planning design concepts. On September 10 and 11, 1999 the park was opened to the public. The 2006 release of animated film Cars brought renewed attention to the efforts to save local U.S. Route 66 main street businesses in towns long bypassed. While Winslow itself is not depicted on-screen, the movie's credits list both La Posada Hotel and Diane Patterson's souvenir shop at Standin 'on the Corner Park among the many Mother Road locations at which Pixar studio personnel conducted exhaustive interviews as part of extensive research for the film. On October 18, 2004, there was a fire at the Standin 'on the Corner Park. While the face of the building and the actual corner survived, the rest of the building was burned down.

Johnson and most famously performed by Elvis Presley. It is a tale of unrequited love during the holidays and is a longstanding staple of Christmas music, especially in the country genre. Contents (hide) 1 Initial recordings and major versions 2 Other charting versions 3 References 4 External links Initial recordings and major versions (edit) The song was first recorded by DoyeO'Dell in 1948, and was popularized the following year in three separate recordings: one by country artist Ernest Tubb, one by musical conductor and arranger Hugo Winterhalter and his orchestra and chorus, and one by bandleader Russ Morgan and his orchestra (the latter featuring lead vocals by Morgan and backing vocals by singers credited as the Morganaires). Tubb's version spent the first week of January 1950 at No. 1 on Billboard magazine's Most-Played Juke Box (Country& Western) Records chart, while Winterhalter's version peaked at No. 9 on Billboard's Records Most Played by Disk Jockeys chart and Morgan's version reached No. 11 on Billboard's Best-Selling Pop Singles chart. Both Morgan's and Winterhalter's versions featured a shorter pop edit of the original lyrics. Also in 1950 crooner Billy Eckstine recorded his rendition, backed by the orchestra of Russ Case, with these shortened lyrics in a variation close to what is now the common standard for this song; the orchestral backing of this recording has often been wrongly accredited to Winterhalter. Elvis Presley cemented the status of ``Blue Christmas'' as a rock-and-roll holiday classic by recording it for his 1957 LP Elvis 'Christmas Album. Presley's version is notable musicologically as well as culturally in that the vocal group the Jordanaires (especially in the soprano line, sung by Millie Kirkham) replace many major and just minor thirds with neutral and septimal minor thirds, respectively. In addition to contributing to the overall tone of the song, the resulting ``blue notes'' constitute a musical play on words that provides an ``inside joke'' or ``quail egg'' to trained ears. ``Blue Christmas'' was also included on a 1957 45 EP (Extended Play) entitled Elvis Sings Christmas Songs (EPA-4108), which also included ``Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)'' on side one, with ``Santa Claus Is Back in Town'' and ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' on side two. Presley's original 1957 version was released as a commercially available single for the first time in 1964. This single was also a hit in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 11 on the British singles chart during the week of 26 December 1964. The rock band The Beach Boys recorded a version featuring Brian Wilson on lead vocals, releasing it in the United States on November 16, 1964, in two separate formats simultaneously: (a) the B-side of ``The Man with All the Toys'' single. (b) a track on The Beach Boys 'Christmas Album. The Beach Boys 'version reached No. 3 on the US Christmas charts, but did not chart in the UK. Other charting versions (edit) This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Following the success of Presley's version, the song has been recorded by a host of rock and country artists, as well as some working in other genres. The following are charting recordings. 1960: The Browns 'version peaked at No. 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in December 1960. 1982: Shakin 'Stevens 'version peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart 2008: Martina McBride's virtual duet with Elvis Presley on the album Christmas Duets reached No. 36 on the US Country Chart (also included on are-released version of her 2013 album White Christmas entitled The Classic Christmas Album) References (edit) Jump up^ Badman, Keith.

The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. Number of courts (edit) Article III authorizes one Supreme Court, but does not set the number of justices that must be appointed to it. Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 refers to a Chief Justice (who shall preside over the impeachment trial of a President). The number of justices is fixed by statute at nine: the one chief justice, and eight associate justices. Proposals to divide the Supreme Court into separate panels have been made, but all have failed. Because all such proposals have failed, the Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of such a division. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote, ``the Constitution does not appear to authorize two or more Supreme Courts functioning in effect as separate courts.'' The Supreme Court is the only federal court that is explicitly mandated by the Constitution. During the Constitutional Convention, a proposal was made for the Supreme Court to be the only federal court, having both original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. This proposal was rejected in favor of the provision that exists today. Under this provision, the Congress may create inferior (i.e., lower) courts under both Article III, Section 1, and Article I, Section 8. The Article III courts, which are also known as ``constitutional courts'', were first created by the Judiciary Act of 1789. Article I courts, which are also known as ``legislative courts'', consist of regulatory agencies, such as the United States Tax Court. Article III courts are the only ones with judicial power, and so decisions of regulatory agencies remain subject to review by Article III courts. However, cases not requiring ``judicial determination'' may come before Article I courts. In the case of Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land& Improvement Co. 59 U.S. 272 (1855), the Supreme Court ruled that cases involving ``a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty'' inherently involve judicial determination and must come before Article III courts. Other cases, such as bankruptcy cases, have been held not to involve judicial determination, and may therefore go before Article I courts. Similarly, several courts in the District of Columbia, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress, are Article I courts rather than Article III courts. This article was expressly extended to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through Federal Law 89-571, 80 Stat. 764, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966. This transformed the article IV United States territorial court in Puerto Rico, created in 1900, to an Article III federal judicial district court. The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937--frequently called the court-packing plan,--was a legislative initiative to add more justices to the Supreme Court proposed by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt shortly after his victory in the 1936 presidential election. Although the bill aimed generally to overhaul and modernize all of the federal court system, its central and most controversial provision would have granted the President power to appoint an additional Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court for every sitting member over the age of701\u20442, up to a maximum of six. The Constitution is silent when it comes to judges of courts which have been abolished. The Judiciary Act of 1801 increased the number of courts to permit the Federalist President John Adams to appoint a number of Federalist judges before Thomas Jefferson took office. When Jefferson became President, the Congress abolished several of these courts and made no provision for the judges of those courts. Judicial Code of 1911 abolished ``circuit riding'' and transferred the circuit courts authority and jurisdiction to the district courts. Tenure (edit) The Constitution provides that judges ``shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.'' The term ``good behavior'' is interpreted to mean that judges may serve for the remainder of their lives, although they may resign or retire voluntarily. A judge may also be removed by impeachment and conviction by congressional vote (hence the term good behavior); this has occurred fourteen times. Three other judges, Mark W. Delahay, George W. English, and Samuel B. Kent, chose to resign rather than go through the impeachment process. Salaries (edit) The compensation of judges may not be decreased, but may be increased, during their continuance in office. Section 2: judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury (edit) Section 2 delineates federal judicial power, and brings that power into execution by conferring original jurisdiction and also appellate jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. Additionally, this section requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, except impeachment cases. The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States;--between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Clause 1: cases and controversies (edit) Main article: Case or Controversy Clause Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing, mootness, or ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have a genuine interest at stake in the case. In Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), the Supreme Court denied jurisdiction to cases brought under a statute permitting certain Native Americans to bring suit against the United States to determine the constitutionality of a law allocating tribal lands. Counsel for both sides were to be paid from the federal Treasury. The Supreme Court held that, though the United States was a defendant, the case in question was not an actual controversy; rather, the statute was merely devised to test the constitutionality of a certain type of legislation. Thus the Court's ruling would be nothing more than an advisory opinion; therefore, the court dismissed the suit for failing to present a ``case or controversy.'' A significant omission is that although Clause 1 provides that federal judicial power shall extend to ``the laws of the United States,'' it does not also provide that it shall extend to the laws of the several or individual states. In turn, the Judiciary Act of 1789 and subsequent acts never granted the U.S. Supreme Court the power to review decisions of state supreme courts on pure issues of state law. It is this silence which tacitly made state supreme courts the final expositors of the common law in their respective states. They were free to diverge from English precedents and from each other on the vast majority of legal issues which had never been made part of federal law by the Constitution, and the U.S. Supreme Court could do nothing about that, as it would ultimately concede in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938). By way of contrast, other English-speaking federations like Australia and Canada never adopted the Erie doctrine. That is, their highest courts have always possessed plenary power to impose a uniform nationwide common law upon all lower courts and never adopted the strong American distinction between federal and state common law. Eleventh Amendment and State sovereign immunity (edit) Main articles: Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and Sovereign immunity in the United States In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793), the Supreme Court ruled that Article III, Section 2 abrogated the States 'sovereign immunity and authorized federal courts to hear disputes between private citizens and States. This decision was overturned by the Eleventh Amendment, which was passed by the Congress on March 4, 1794 1 Stat. 402 and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It prohibits the federal courts from hearing any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. Clause 2: original and appellate jurisdiction (edit) See also: Jurisdiction stripping Clause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls, and also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party; the Court has held that the latter requirement is met if the United States has a controversy with a state. In other cases, the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction, which may be regulated by the Congress. The Congress may not, however, amend the Court's original jurisdiction, as was found in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (Cranch 1) 137 (1803) (the same decision which established the principle of judicial review). Marbury held that Congress can neither expand nor restrict the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is different. The Court's appellate jurisdiction is given ``with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.'' Often a court will assert a modest degree of power over a case for the threshold purpose of determining whether it has jurisdiction, and so the word ``power'' is not necessarily synonymous with the word ``jurisdiction''. Judicial review (edit) Main articles: Judicial review and Judicial review in the United States The power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutionality of a statute or treaty, or to review an administrative regulation for consistency with either a statute, a treaty, or the Constitution itself, is an implied power derived in part from Clause 2 of Section 2. Though the Constitution does not expressly provide that the federal judiciary has the power of judicial review, many of the Constitution's Framers viewed such a power as an appropriate power for the federal judiciary to possess. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote, The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents. Others, however, disagreed, claiming that each branch could determine for itself the constitutionality of its actions. A continuation of the text of Federalist No. 78 by Hamilton (below) counterbalances the tone of ``judicial supremacists'' who demand that both Congress and the Executive are compelled by the Constitution to enforce all court decisions, including those that, in their eyes, or those of the People, violate fundamental American principles. Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. (emphasis added) Hamilton continues... It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body. (emphasis added) Marbury v. Madison involved a highly partisan set of circumstances. Though Congressional elections were held in November 1800, the newly elected officers did not take power until March. The Federalist Party had lost the elections. In the words of President Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists ``retired into the judiciary as a stronghold''. In the four months following the elections, the outgoing Congress created several new judgeships, which were filled by President John Adams. In the last-minute rush, however, Federalist Secretary of State John Marshall had neglected to deliver 17 of the commissions to their respective appointees. When James Madison took office as Secretary of State, several commissions remained undelivered. Bringing their claims under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appointees, including William Marbury, petitioned the Supreme Court for the issue of a writ of mandamus, which in English law had been used to force public officials to fulfill their ministerial duties. Here, Madison would be required to deliver the commissions. Secretary of State James Madison, who won Marbury v. Madison, but lost Judicial review. Marbury posed a difficult problem for the court, which was then led by Chief Justice John Marshall, the same person who had neglected to deliver the commissions when he was the Secretary of State. If Marshall's court commanded James Madison to deliver the commissions, Madison might ignore the order, thereby indicating the weakness of the court. Similarly, if the court denied William Marbury's request, the court would be seen as weak. Marshall held that appointee Marbury was indeed entitled to his commission. However, Justice Marshall contended that the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, since it purported to grant original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in cases not involving the States or ambassadors. The ruling thereby established that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. However, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 78, expressed the view that the Courts hold only the power of words, and not the power of compulsion upon those other two branches of government, upon which the Supreme Court is itself dependent. Then in 1820, Thomas Jefferson expressed his deep reservations about the doctrine of judicial review: You seem... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps... Their power (is) the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departmentsco-equal andco-sovereign within themselves. Clause 3: federal trials (edit) A nineteenth-century painting of a jury. Clause 3 of Section 2 provides that Federal crimes, except impeachment cases, must be tried before a jury, unless the defendant waives his right. Also, the trial must be held in the state where the crime was committed. If the crime was not committed in any particular state, then the trial is held in such a place as set forth by the Congress. The United States Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases. Two of the Constitutional Amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights contain related provisions. The Sixth Amendment enumerates the rights of individuals when facing criminal prosecution and the Seventh Amendment establishes an individual's right to a jury trial in certain civil cases. It also inhibits courts from overturning a jury's findings of fact. The Supreme Court has extended the protections of these amendments to individuals facing trial in state courts through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 3: treason (edit) Main article: Treason laws in the United States Iva Toguri, known as Tokyo Rose, and Tomoya Kawakita were two Japanese Americans who were tried for treason after World War II. Section 3 defines treason and its punishment. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. The Constitution defines treason as specific acts, namely ``levying War against (the United States), or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.'' A contrast is therefore maintained with the English law, whereby crimes including conspiring to kill the King or ``violating'' the Queen, were punishable as treason. In Ex Parte Bollman, 8 U.S. 75 (1807), the Supreme Court ruled that ``there must be an actual assembling of men, for the treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war.'' Under English law effective during the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, including the Treason Act 1351, there were essentially five species of treason. Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or imagining) the death of the king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally fornication with women in the royal family of the sort which could call into question the parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause. Section 3 also requires the testimony of two different witnesses on the same overt act, or a confession by the accused in open court, to convict for treason. This rule was derived from an older English statute, the Treason Act 1695. In Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that ``(e) very act, movement, deed, and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be supported by the testimony of two witnesses.'' In Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631 (1947), however, the Supreme Court found that two witnesses are not required to prove intent, nor are two witnesses required to prove that an overt act is treasonable. The two witnesses, according to the decision, are required to prove only that the overt act occurred (eyewitnesses and federal agents investigating the crime, for example). Punishment for treason may not ``work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person'' so convicted. The descendants of someone convicted for treason could not, as they were under English law, be considered ``tainted'' by the treason of their ancestor. Furthermore, Congress may confiscate the property of traitors, but that property must be inheritable at the death of the person convicted. In Federalist No. 43 James Madison wrote regarding the Treason Clause: As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author. Based on the above quotation, it was noted by the lawyer William J. Olson in an amicus curiae in the case Hedges v. Obama that the Treason Clause was one of the enumerated powers of the federal government. He also stated that by defining treason in the U.S. Constitution and placing it in Article III ``the founders intended the power to be checked by the judiciary, ruling out trials by military commissions. As James Madison noted, the Treason Clause also was designed to limit the power of the federal government to punish its citizens for ``adhering to (the) enemies (of the United States by), giving them aid and comfort.''''

Contents 1 Legislative representatives 2 Gerrymandering 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Legislative representatives (edit) In 28 states, the state legislature has primary responsibility for creating a redistricting plan, in many cases subject to approval by the state governor. To reduce the role that legislative politics might play, twelve states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington) determine congressional redistricting by an independent or bipartisan redistricting commission. Five states: Maine, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia give independent bodies authority to propose redistricting plans, but preserve the role of legislatures to approve them. Arkansas has a commission composed of its governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Seven states have only a single representative for the entire state because of their low populations; these are Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. State constitutions and laws also mandate which body has responsibility over drawing the state legislature boundaries. In addition, those municipal governments that are elected on a district basis (as opposed to at-large) also redistrict. Each state has its own standards for creating Congressional and legislative districts. In addition to equalizing the population of districts and complying with Federal requirements, criteria may include attempting to create compact, contiguous districts, trying to keep political units and communities within a single district, and avoiding the drawing of boundaries for purposes of partisan advantage or incumbent protection. In the states where the legislature (or another body where a partisan majority is possible) is in charge of redistricting, the possibility of gerrymandering (the deliberate manipulation of political boundaries for electoral advantage, usually of incumbents or a specific political party) often makes the process very politically contentious, especially when the majorities of the two houses of the legislature, or the legislature and the governor, are from different parties. The state and federal court systems are often involved in resolving disputes over Congressional and legislative redistricting when gridlock prevents redistricting in a timely manner. In addition, the losers to an adopted redistricting plan often challenge it in state and federal courts. Justice Department approval (which is known aspre-clearance) was formerly required under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in certain states that have had a history of racial barriers to voting. Partisan domination of state legislatures and improved technology to design contiguous districts that pack opponents into as few districts as possible have led to district maps which are skewed towards one party. Consequently, many states including Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas have succeeded in reducing or effectively eliminating competition for most House seats in those states. Other states including California, New Jersey and New York have opted to protect incumbents of both parties, reducing the number of competitive districts. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Pennsylvania redistricting effectively allows elected officials to select their constituents by eliminating most of the grounds for constituents to challenge district lines. Redistricting may follow other criteria depending on State and Local governments: compactness contiguity equal population preservation of existing political communities partisan fairness racial fairness Esri has offered its services as a platform for redestricting to allow for complete government transparency. Since the process of redistricting is intrinsically linked to geography, GIS can address this issue effectively. Gerrymandering (edit) Main article: Gerrymandering Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing district lines to achieve political gain for legislators. The practice of gerrymandering involves the manipulation of district drawing in aims to leave out, or include, specific populations in a legislator's district to ensure his/ her reelection.

His four lieutenants die preserving him. Awakening in 1983, he believes humanity has lost its way without his presence. Aiming to destroy and remake the world, he recruits a Cairo pickpocket Ororo Munroe, who can control the weather, and upgrades her power. In East Berlin, shape-shifting mutant Raven investigates an underground fight club and discovers Kurt Wagner, a blue skinned mutant who can teleport. Raven rescues Kurt and requests black marketeer Caliban to transport him to America. En Sabah Nur recruits Caliban's enforcer, Psylocke, who leads him to mutant-fighting champion Angel. En Sabah Nur enhances both of their powers, transforming Angel's wings into metal. Alex Summers discovers that his younger brother Scott is manifesting a mutation for shooting optic beams. Alex takes Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's educational institute in Westchester County, New York, hoping that Xavier and Hank McCoy will teach him to control his abilities. Scott meets the telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey, and the two develop an attraction, while Raven brings Kurt to the institute. En Sabah Nur's powers cause disturbances around the world, leading Xavier and Alex to consult with CIA operative Moira MacTaggert, who has been researching the legend of Nur. In Communist Poland, the metal-controlling mutant Erik Lehnsherr lives with his wife and their young daughter, Nina. When En Sabah Nur's resurrection causes a worldwide earthquake, he uses his powers to save a coworker, prompting the militia to capture him. When one of them shoots and kills Erik's family, Erik retaliates by killing the entire militia. En Sabah Nur later approaches the devastated Erik and takes him to Auschwitz, where Erik's power first manifested. Persuaded by En Sabah Nur, Erik has his powers enhanced, destroys the camp, and joins En Sabah Nur. En Sabah Nur remotely accesses Cerebro, a brainwave-amplifying device Xavier uses to locate mutants and forces the telepathic Xavier to make the global superpowers launch their entire nuclear arsenals into space to prevent interference with En Sabah Nur's plan. He and his new Four Horsemen arrive at the mansion and kidnap Xavier. Attempting to stop them, Alex accidentally causes an explosion that destroys the mansion. Peter Maximoff, having realized that he is Erik's biological son and hoping that Xavier can help to find him, arrives just in time; he uses hissuper-speed to evacuate the students and teachers before the explosion destroys the building, but fails to save Alex, who dies in the explosion. Colonel William Stryker's forces subsequently capture Hank, Raven, Peter, and Moira, and take them to a military facility for interrogation. Scott, Jean, and Kurt follow covertly, and liberate their comrades using Stryker's brainwashed experiment Weapon X, whose memories Jean partially restores. At En Sabah Nur's behest, Erik uses his powers to control the Earth's magnetic poles, causing destruction across the planet. Sabah Nur plans to transfer his consciousness into Xavier's body, and use Xavier's power to enslave every person on Earth. Xavier secretly sends a telepathic distress call to Jean, and the others travel to Cairo to battle Sabah Nur and his horsemen. They rescue Xavier in a plane, but he loses his hair as the process nears completion. Angel and Psylocke attack the plane and Nightcrawler teleports them away. As the plane crashes, Psylocke jumps to safety while Angel is killed in the plane crash. Erik and Ororo are persuaded to turn on En Sabah Nur and, with the help of Scott, they keep him occupied physically, while Xavier fights him telepathically in the astral plane. Finally, Xavier encourages Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers, incinerating En Sabah Nur, killing him for good, while Psylocke escapes. Xavier and Moira rekindle their relationship. Erik and Jean help reconstruct the school, but Erik refuses Xavier's offer to stay and help teach. Peter decides not to tell Erik yet that he is Erik's son. Using confiscated Sentinels, Hank and Raven train the newX-Men recruits: Scott, Jean, Ororo, Kurt, and Peter. In apost-credits scene, men in black suits visit the Weapon X facility to retrieve data on Stryker's mutant research, including anX-ray and a blood sample marked ``Weapon X'', on behalf of the Essex Corporation. Cast (edit) Cast ofX-Men: Apocalypse at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International. Top to bottom (scrollable): McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Isaac, Hoult, Munn, Peters, Smit-McPhee, Turner, Sheridan, Shipp, Condor, Till, and Hardy. James McAvoy as Charles Xavier/ Professor X: A mutant pacifist and the world's most powerful telepath, who is the founder of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and leads the team of mutants known as theX-Men, in order to protect humankind and battle against the deadly enemy within. McAvoy shaved his head for the role. Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr/ Magneto: A mutant Auschwitz survivor with the ability to control magnetic fields and manipulate metal, who was once Xavier's closest ally and best friend until his belief that mankind and mutantkind would never coexist led to their separation. He is globally infamous for attempting to assassinate U.S. President Richard Nixon on live broadcast 10 years prior. Bill Milner appears in archival footage as a Young Erik. Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/ Mystique: A mutant with shapeshifting abilities, globally renowned for saving Nixon's life 10 years prior. She is also Xavier's once closest ally and his adopted sister. Lawrence said, ``she hears about what happened to Erik and she wants to seek him out and help him.'' Oscar Isaac as En Sabah Nur/ Apocalypse: Born in ancient times, and presumably the world's first mutant, he has a variety of destructive superhuman abilities, including telekinesis, cyberpathy, teleportation, and the ability to augment other mutants 'abilities. Isaac described Apocalypse as the ``creative-slash-destructive force of the Earth.'' He added, ``When things start to go awry, or when things seem like they're not moving towards evolution, (Apocalypse) destroys those civilizations.'' Isaac had to go through extensive makeup and prosthetics applications, and wore high-heeled boots to appear taller and a 40-pound suit. The full costume was uncomfortable, particularly in the humid environment of the outdoor scenes, which forced Isaac to go to a cooling tent between takes. Apocalypse's previous old-form (seen at the beginning of the film) was played by Berdj Garabedian, a 70-year-old Canadian real estate agent in his first credited film role. Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/ Beast: A mutant with leonine attributes, prehensile feet and superhuman physical abilities. Hank acts as a teacher in Xavier's school and he builds inventions for troubled students. He also built theX-Jet. Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert: A CIA operative who first met and fell in love with Xavier inX-Men: First Class, where he wiped portions of her memories of him and theX-Men at the end. Simon Kinberg said they are ``essentially, strangers'' when they meet in this film. Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff/ Quicksilver: A mutant who can move, think, and perceive at hypersonic speeds, and the son of Magneto. Describing the relationship between Quicksilver and Magneto, Peters stated, ``I have learned that he's my father at this point and I am trying to... I don't know what I can say. I'm trying to... Yeah. It's like an adoptive child or any kind of child who has a strange father trying to... He knows who he is now so he is trying to find him. He's been searching for him. It's been 10 years and he hasn't found him and then something happens.'' Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/ Cyclops: A mutant who fires destructive optic beams and wears a visor or sunglasses to stabilize and contain them, and who is the younger brother of Havok. Sheridan describes Cyclops as ``angry and a bit lost.'' He added, ``He's now learning about being a mutant and trying to handle his powers.'' Sophie Turner as Jean Grey: A mutant who is scared of her telepathic and telekinetic power, and one of Charles Xavier's most prized students. Turner states that she was cast in the film because of the ``dark side'' of her character Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones. She compared Jean to Sansa and described being an outcast in the human world, who struggles with her power and gift, the same way Sansa, who wanted to live a normal life, felt. Turner learned archery in preparation for the role. Olivia Munn as Psylocke: A mutant with telepathic, telekinetic and psionic abilities. Her abilities also include projecting purple psychic energy, usually into the form of an energy blade that can burn through metal. Munn described Psylocke as ``very lethal, very powerful and very strong.'' She practiced sword fighting in preparation for the role. Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt Wagner/ Nightcrawler: A German teleporting mutant and one of Charles Xavier's new students. Singer said Nightcrawler is a source of comic relief. Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/ Storm: A young mutant orphan who can control weather. Storm is discovered by Apocalypse in Cairo. Shipp shaved her head partially, and sported a Mohawk for the role. Lucas Till as Alex Summers/ Havok: A mutant who has the ability to absorb energy and release it with destructive force from his body, and the older brother of Cyclops. Josh Helman as Colonel William Stryker: A military officer who hates mutants and has, in the ten years since Days of Future Past, been developing his own plans for resolving ``the mutant problem''. Ben Hardy as Angel: A mutant with bird-like feathered wings, gaining metallic wings which can also be used as razor sharp projectiles as a result, similar to his Archangel counterpart in the comics. Hardy practiced indoor skydiving in preparation for his role. Lana Condor as Jubilee: A mutant student at Charles's school who has the ability to create psionic energy plasmoids. Discussing her first day onX-Men: Apocalypse, Condor says: ``I was very new and it was my first role. I'd never been on a set before or in front of a camera, so I didn't know what to expect. The first day we shot scenes in an 80s-themed mall with hundreds of extras in 80s gear, plus crew and cameras. It was surreal.'' She also discussed the character of Jubilee and how she became the mutant: ``It's a lot easier when you have the costume, as that helps bring everything to life. She has her iconic yellow jacket, which is a staple. It's very bold and confident, like her. A lot of her costumes are super 80s. I also listened to music from the 80s and that helped.'' T\u00f3mas Lemarquis portrays Caliban, a mutant with the ability to sense and track other mutants. Wrestler ``Giant'' Gustav Claude Ouimet plays The Blob, Angel's opponent in an underground fight club. Monique Ganderton portrays one of En Sabah Nur's original lieutenants, Death. Hugh Jackman makes an uncredited appearance as Logan/ Wolverine, in his Weapon X form. In that same scene, director Bryan Singer cameos as a guard who is killed by Wolverine as he attempts to escape the complex.X-Menco-creator Stan Lee and his wife Joan B. Lee make a cameo appearance together, as bystanders witnessing the launch of nuclear missiles worldwide; this was Joan's last film before her death the following year. \u017deljko Ivanek cameos as a Pentagon scientist. In a deleted scene, Scott shows Jean a record from Dazzler. The scene is not in the theatrical film, but is included on the home video release. Archive footage was used of Caleb Landry Jones as Sean Cassidy/ Banshee, journalist Jessica Savitch and actors Leslie Parrish and Michael Forest (the latter two appearing in footage with dialogue from the 1967 Star Trek episode ``Who Mourns for Adonais?''). Production (edit) Development (edit) The film was announced by Bryan Singer in December 2013 via Twitter, before Days of Future Past was released to theaters. In the same month, Simon Kinberg, Dan Harris, and Michael Dougherty were revealed by Singer to be attached to work on the film's story. According to Singer, the film would focus on the origin of the mutants, and features the younger versions of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm. Singer also said that he was considering Gambit and a younger version of Nightcrawler to appear. According to Kinberg, it would take place in 1983, and completes a trilogy that began with 2011'sX-Men: First Class. In September 2014, 20th Century Fox officially announced that Singer would direct the film. Singer has called the film ``kind of a conclusion of sixX-Men films, yet a potential rebirth of younger, newer characters'' and the ``true birth of theX-Men''. Writing (edit) It will address historical mutant-cy, meaning the deep past, mutant origins and things like that. It's something that's always intrigued me when we think about our Gods and our history and miracles and powers.--Bryan Singer on what will be seen inX-Men: Apocalypse. Singer said that Apocalypse is the main focus of the film. Kinberg said that the younger versions of Scott Summers, Storm, and Jean Grey appearing in the film are ``as much a part of the film as the main cast''. He described Summers as ``not yet the squeaky-clean leader'', Storm as a ``troubled character who is going down the wrong path in life'', and Grey as ``complex, interesting and not fully mature.'' Kinberg also said that the film delivers on the dramatic story and emotion of the last two films and that it acts like the culmination of the main characters portrayed by Lawrence, McAvoy, Fassbender and Hoult. Kinberg said First Class, Days of Future Past, and Apocalypse formed a trilogy about Mystique, explaining, ``She starts in First Class entirely on Charles 'side, ends up following Erik, and we then find her in Days of Future Past and she's on her own because Erik is gone. She's on her own side in that movie but is drawn toward Charles by the end of the film and shoots Erik. Then in Apocalypse she comes back to Charles. There's a full circle narrative over the span of this little trilogy that is about Mystique from beginning with Charles in the mansion and ending with Charles in the mansion, but not as the same timid little girl we met in First Class.'' Kinberg was paid$8 million for writing the script, the same amount he received forX-Men: Days of Future Past. The plot was partially inspired by the 1986X-Men story arc ``The Fall of the Mutants''. Casting (edit) In October 2014, casting forX-Men: Apocalypse began. In November, Singer confirmed that Oscar Isaac would portray Apocalypse. In January 2015, Singer announced that Alexandra Shipp, Sophie Turner, and Tye Sheridan would portray young Storm, Jean, and Cyclops, respectively. The same month, Kinberg confirmed that Rose Byrne would reprise her role as Moira MacTaggert in the film. In February, Kodi Smit-McPhee was cast as Nightcrawler and Ben Hardy was cast in an unspecified role. In March, Singer announced that Lana Condor was cast as Jubilation Lee. In April, Singer confirmed that Hardy would portray Angel, Olivia Munn would portray Psylocke, and Lucas Till would return as Havok. In May, Singer announced that the mutant Caliban would appear in the film. In July, Hoult revealed on Conan that Josh Helman would return as William Stryker. In April 2016, Hugh Jackman confirmed that he would make a cameo appearance as Wolverine. The Englefield House, Berkshire, England served as theX-Mansion. Filming (edit) Principal photography commenced on April 27, 2015, in Montreal, Canada. In late August, the first-unit production for the film wrapped. Additional filming took place in January 2016. Australia-based Rising Sun Pictures provided, as it did forX-Men: Days of Future Past, the effects for Quicksilver's time-stopping, quick motion effects in the mansion rescue scene, and also other effects, including when Cyclops splits Professor Xavier's favorite tree in half. Aerial footage of snow-capped mountains as Stryker traveled in his helicopter to the secret base was provided by SmartDrones of St. Albert, Alberta, Canada. Music (edit) On March 2, 2015, it was announced that John Ottman, who composed the scores for X2 andX-Men: Days of Future Past, would return to write and compose the score for Apocalypse. On May 20, 2016, the official soundtrack was released as a digital download. In addition to Ottman's score, the film features a remix of the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's seventh symphony entitled ``Beethoven Havok'' and two songs contemporary to the film's 1983 setting, ``Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' by Eurythmics and ``The Four Horsemen'' by Metallica. Marketing (edit) In July 2015, Singer, Lee, Hugh Jackman and cast-members McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Isaac, Hoult, Munn, Peters, Smit-McPhee, Turner, Sheridan, Shipp, Condor, Till and Hardy gave a presentation at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, together with the release of the film's first teaser poster, featuring En Sabah Nur and a wreckage of theX-Mansion. Footage from the film was screened. In October 2015, Mars Chocolate partnered with 20th Century Fox for the marketing of the film, usingM&M chocolates in their promotional materials. The deal included retail displays and special packaging markings, TV and cinema commercials, and social media posts featuringM&M's characters mixed with elements of theX-Men. The first image ofM&M candies wearing Storm and Magneto costumes was released on the day of the announcement. In December 2015, Kia Motors collaborated with 20th Century Fox to create a custom Kia Sportage to promote the film. Designed after Mystique, the car was revealed at the 2016 Australian Open. It is Kia's second ``X-Car'' project after the Kia Sorento customized for the home media release of Days of Future Past and the 2015 Australian Open. A trailer released in the same month received criticism from Rajan Zed, a United States-based Hindu cleric, who stated that the part where Apocalypse claims himself to have been called ``Krishna'' was an offense to the Hindu religion, and demanded that Singer remove all references to Krishna from the trailer, and the film itself. The references to Krishna were removed from the film's final cut. On January 4, 2016, Kia Motors released the first promo video of the car, featuring Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal. Concerning the character Apocalypse, the director Bryan Singer has said, The way I describe him the most, the best is he to me is the God of the Old Testament and all that comes with that. If there isn't the order and the worship then I'll open up the Earth and swallow you whole, and that was the God of the Old Testament. I started from there and when Oscar and I met we began discussing, since he isn't really God, he's the first mutant perhaps, but he's not God necessarily, he's imbued with certain unique powers. Some of them may or may not be from this Earth, we don't know. In April 2016, Coldwell Banker partnered with 20th Century Fox to list theX-Mansion for$75 million. The fictional listing included a video tour of the mansion and stories of the home from the perspective of characters such as Charles Xavier and Scott Summers. The fake property was listed by agent Kala V. Rhomedren, an anagram for Raven Darkholme. That same month, Fox released a faux TV show called ``In the Footsteps of...'' narrated by George Takei which is inspired by the classic TV series In Search of... that focus on En Sabah Nur's origins. In May 2016, Fox released a faux TV Commercial for the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters with Lana Condor as Jubilee. They also released a video voiced mail message a week later and a faux TV show called Fables of the Flush& Fabulous with Robin Leach which is inspired by Leach's show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Billboard controversy (edit) Billboards in Los Angeles and New York City promoting the film garnered controversy for showing an image of Apocalypse choking Mystique, with critics saying the ad advocates violence against women. Among those opposed to the material was actress Rose McGowan, who told The Hollywood Reporter: ``There is a major problem when the men and women at 20th Century Fox think casual violence against women is the way to market a film. There is no context in the ad, just a woman getting strangled. The fact that no one flagged this is offensive and frankly, stupid.'' In apologizing for the billboard, Fox said it intended to remove the image from circulation. Release (edit)X-Men: Apocalypse had its world premiere in London on May 9, 2016. The film was released in20,796 screens across 76 international markets on May 18, 2016, one week before its North American debut. Apocalypse was issued both 3D and 2D formats, and in IMAX 3D in select international markets, using the DMR process. It opened in Korea on May 25 and in China on June 3. It was released in Japan on August 11. Home Media (edit) The film was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on digital download on September 9, 2016, and on DVD, Blu-ray, 3D Blu-Ray and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 4, 2016. The film topped the national home video sales charts for the week ending on October 9, 2016. Reception (edit) Box Office (edit)X-Men: Apocalypse grossed$155.4 million in the U.S. and Canada and$388.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of$543.9 million against a budget of$178 million. The film is the fourth-highest-grossing film in theX-Men series (without adjusting for inflation), behind Deadpool, Logan, andX-Men: Days of Future Past. It made 27% less than Days of Future Past.X-Men: Apocalypse opened in the United States on May 27, 2016 alongside Alice Through the Looking Glass and was projected to gross around$80 million from4,150 theaters in its opening weekend, and up to$100 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend.

Critical response (edit)X-Men: Apocalypse received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 305 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/ 10. The website's critical consensus reads, ``Overloaded action and a cliched villain take the focus away from otherwise strong performers and resonant themes, makingX-Men: Apocalypse a middling chapter of the venerable superhero franchise.'' On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating ``mixed or average reviews''. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ``A\u2212'' on anA+ to F scale. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club commented, ``Much of what makesX-Men: Apocalypse legitimately interesting also makes it frustrating and lopsided, since Singer and screenwriter-producer Simon Kinberg remain committed to the structure of an overlong comic-book blockbuster, complete with a climax in which the world has to be saved using as many different colors of energy beam as possible.'' Mike Ryan of Uproxx disparaged the film's story as redundant and stale, arguing ``I get it: Life is hard for mutants. We all get it. It's literally the only thing mutants ever seem to talk about. It is odd that other superheroes seem to get to have some fun, but never theX-Men. Here we are, 16 years later, and everyone involved is still sad. It feels repetitive.'' Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote, ``X-Men: Apocalypse is the kind of weightless, soulless trifle of a bore that makes comic book superhero movies look bad and makes me not look forward to the next installment.'' HelenO'Hara of Empire criticized the performances of the main cast and stated that the film felt ``messier and heavier than Days of Future Past.'' On the other hand, Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, calling it ``a thinking person's action movie'' and complimenting its high stakes. Richard Roeper called the film ``a visual feast'' and lauded its cast, saying ``Even the hardcore geeks who like to get their Comic-Con on might be feeling a little superhero fatigue right about now. Still. You owe it to yourself to see Quicksilver do his thing.''

The CJI also heads their administrative functions. As head of the supreme court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation of cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important matters of law. In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India and the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the Chief Justice allocates all work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to him or her (forre-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by a larger bench of more judges. On the administrative side, the Chief Justice carries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of court officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the supervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. It has been an unbroken convention for decades now, to appoint thesenior-most judge of the supreme court as the CJI. The present CJI is Justice Dipak Misra and is the 45th CJI since January 1950, the year the Constitution came into effect and the supreme court came into being. He succeeded Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar on 28 August 2017 and will remain in office till 2 October 2018, the day he retires on turning 65 years in age. Contents (hide) 1 Appointment 2 Removal 3 Acting President 4 List of Chief Justices of India 5 Remuneration 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Appointment (edit) Article 124 of the Constitution of India provides for the manner of appointing judges to the Supreme Court. Though no specific provision exists in the Constitution for appointing the Chief Justice, who, as a result, is appointed like the other judges conventionally, the outgoing CJI recommends the name of thesenior-most judge (i.e. by date of appointment to the Supreme Court) for appointment by the President of India, as his successor. Once earlier, when prime minister Nehru wanted to see Justice M.C. Mahajan, next in line to become the CJI, superseded on Justice Patanjali Sastri's retirement, three judges of the supreme court, including Justice Mukherjea, who Nehru wanted as the next Chief Justice, offered to resign. He relented before the judges and the convention of seniority in appointment was left undisturbed. On the contrary, this convention has been breached on a few occasions during the tenure of prime minister Indira Gandhi. She got Justice A.N. Ray appointed as CJI, superseding three judges senior to him allegedly because he had favoured her government, and when Justice H.R. Khanna was overlooked for the post for upholding the constitution as superior to her government's acts and for curtailing her powers which she had arrogated to herself during the Emergency Removal (edit) Article 124 (4) of Constitution of India lays down the procedure for removal of a Judge of Supreme Court which is applicable to Chief Justice as well. Once appointed, the Chief Justice remains in s office until the age of 65 years. He can be removed only through a process of impeachment by Parliament as follows: A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.--Article 124 (4), Constitution of India, Source: Acting President (edit) The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969 of India provides that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) shall act as the President of India in the event of the offices of both the President and the Vice President being vacant. When President Zakir Hussain died in office, the Vice President V.V. Giri, acted as the President. Later, Mr. Giri resigned as the Vice President. The CJI, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah then became the acting President of India. Thesenior-most judge of the Supreme Court became the acting CJI.

Struggling to find meaning in their endless exploration, Captain James T. Kirk has applied for a promotion to vice admiral; he recommends Spock as his replacement. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu reunites with his family, Montgomery Scott works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and Nyota Uhura amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his counterpart from the original timeline, has died. The Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. Its occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula. As the Enterprise exits an asteroid field within the nebula, a massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly overwhelms the starship, disconnecting the ship's warp nacelles in a matter of seconds. The swarm's leader, Krall, and his crew board the crippled Enterprise, capture and kill many crew members, and recover a relic, the Abronath, that Kirk had recently obtained. Scotty manages to restore enough power for the ship to attempt to flee, but Krall orders his swarm to destroy the Enterprise, and they smash the ship in half. Kirk, having recovered the Abronath, orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the Enterprise to crash on Altamid. On the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura and other survivors. Kirk and Pavel Chekov, accompanied by Kalara, locate the Enterprise's saucer section. Realising that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. To escape Krall's soldiers, Kirk and Chekov use the ship's thrusters to flip the saucer over, and Kalara is killed in the maneuver. Elsewhere on the planet, Dr. Leonard McCoy and a wounded Spock search for other survivors. Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at Yorktown was due to his intention to leave Starfleet to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded USS Franklin, an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Threatening to kill the crew, Krall coerces Ensign Syl to hand over the Abronath that she had concealed for Kirk, then uses it on her to demonstrate an ancient bioweapon that can disintegrate any humanoid. With the device complete, Krall intends to kill Yorktown's inhabitants, then use the base to attack the Federation. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to Yorktown. As the Enterprise survivors power up the Franklin and launch her in pursuit of Krall, they deduce that such a massive swarm must coordinate its attacks via radio signals, specifically on the VHF frequency. Scott transports Spock and McCoy into one of the swarm ships to seize control of it. Matching the swarm's frequency, they jam and disorient the swarm by broadcasting the 1994 song ``Sabotage'' by the Beastie Boys, destroying almost the entire fleet. Krall and his three surviving ships, one of which contains Spock and McCoy, are chased by the Franklin through Yorktown. The chase ends at the station's headquarters, where the Franklin's sudden appearance causes the three ships to smash into it. As Krall flees into the starbase, Uhura and Kirk discover from the Franklin's logs that he is actually Balthazar Edison, former captain of the Franklin. Apre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the Xindi. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used the extinct natives's technology to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, andre-purposed the ancient race's dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking the Federation had abandoned them, Edison planned to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into Yorktown's ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can activate, Kirk ejects it and Edison into space, where the weapon consumes Edison. Using the alien ship they commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space. In the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the files of Captain Edison and the USS Franklin crew. Kirk decides to keep his position as the Enterprise's captain; Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet, and begins to renew his relationship with Uhura. On Kirk's recommendation, Jaylah is accepted into Starfleet Academy. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they watch the construction of their new ship, the USS Enterprise-A--and when the ship is completed, they resume their mission.

Production (edit) Development (edit) Abrams returned only as a producer so he could focus on directing Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Writer-producer Roberto Orci was announced as director in May 2014. He would have been making his directorial debut. However, in December, Orci's role was also listed as a producer only, with Edgar Wright considered to replace him as director, along with a shortlist of others, including Rupert Wyatt, Morten Tyldum, Daniel Espinosa, Justin Lin and Duncan Jones. Also, Star Trek actor and director Jonathan Frakes expressed interest in the job. At the end of the month, Lin was announced as director of the third installment. Screenplay (edit) In 2013, Orci had begun writing the script with Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne, with Payne saying of the script in March, ``We really want to get back to the sense of exploration and wonder. The kind of optimistic sense of the future that Star Trek has always kind of had at its core. It's the Chicago Bulls in space, in terms of these people who are all awesome at their job.'' In January 2015, after Orci's departure as director, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount ``had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y.'' Pegg had been asked to make the new film ``more inclusive'', stating that the solution was to ``make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent.'' Casting (edit) The first film's major cast members signed on for two sequels as part of their original deals. In 2014, early in the film's development, William Shatner said that he was contacted by producer Abrams to see if he would be interested in a possible role, but as the process continued and the script changed hands, the role never materialized. Alice Eve was not included in the film despite her character having joined the Enterprise crew at the end of the last installment, because Pegg, in writing the script, did not have anything meaningful for her to do; however, he stressed that Eve could appear in a later installment. Joseph Gatt's cyborg Science Officer 0718 was dropped from the film after a rewrite. In March 2015, Idris Elba was in early talks to play the villain, and he was confirmed for the role in the following months. Pegg noted that the villain would be an original one, rather than a known antagonist from past stories in the Star Trek franchise. In April, Sofia Boutella joined the cast in a lead role, and in early July, Deep Roy was confirmed to reprise his role of Keenser. That month, Joe Taslim was added to the cast opposite Elba's villain, and by August, Lydia Wilson joined as well. In March 2016, Shohreh Aghdashloo was cast as Admiral Paris for reshoots on the film. Filming (edit) Principal photography on the film began on June 25, 2015, in Vancouver, and Squamish, British Columbia, after several delays caused by multiple script rejections. Additional filming locations were Seoul, South Korea, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Principal filming ended on October 15, 2015. In March 2016, production underwent reshoots, with Aghdashloo added to the cast. Music (edit) Main article: Star Trek Beyond (soundtrack) In August 2015, composer Michael Giacchino confirmed that he would return to write the score. On June 26, 2016, singer Rihanna released a teaser across her social media accounts for a single for the film entitled ``Sledgehammer'', and the song premiered the following day. Release (edit) The film was released in 2D, RealD3D, IMAX 3D and Barco Escape. In August 2014, it was announced that Paramount had pushed back the release of the film to 2016, for the 50th anniversary celebration of the debut of Gene Roddenberry's original sci-fi series. In December, it was announced that the film was to be released on July 8, 2016. In September 2015, the film's release date was pushed back to July 22, 2016. The film was released in Dolby Cinema format in selected theaters. The film had its Australian premiere in Sydney on July 7. Marketing (edit) A teaser trailer for the film was released on December 14, 2015, and was criticized by some fans for focusing too much on action, and for featuring the Beastie Boys song ``Sabotage'', which many considered out of place, despite its use in the first film of the rebooted series. Pegg expressed similar thoughts of dissatisfaction with the teaser, saying that he ``didn't love it'' because ``I know there's a lot more to the film.'' He interpreted the trailer to be a way of the marketing team saying, ``Come and see this movie! It's full of action and fun!'' A second trailer was released on May 20, 2016, to warmer reviews. A third and final trailer was released on June 27, 2016, featuring Rihanna's single ``Sledgehammer''. Home Media (edit) Star Trek Beyond was released on Digital HD on October 4, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on November 1, 2016. Reception (edit) Box Office (edit) Star Trek Beyond underperformed financially at the box office. Scott Mendelson of Forbes observed that one factor contributing to the film's underperformance was its untimely release in a crowded summer in which it was surrounded by other films like Ghostbusters, Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad. He also noted that had Paramount released the film for the Star Trek's 50th anniversary on September 8, the film could have benefited from that occasion, as demonstrated in October 2012 when MGM released the James Bond film Skyfall (which went on to gross over$1 billion) for that series '50th anniversary. Star Trek Beyond grossed$158.8 million in the United States and Canada and$184.6 million in other countries for a worldwide total of$343.5 million, against a production budget of$185 million. It had a global opening of$89.2 million and an IMAX opening of$11.6 million on 571 IMAX screens. Industry analyst Danny Cox had previously estimated that in order for the film to break even, it would have to earn$340--350 million worldwide, and ended losing an estimated$50.5 million. North america (edit) In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross$50--60 million in its opening weekend. It opened alongside Ice Age: Collision Course and Lights Out, but critics noted that the film did not face any direct competition with them. It opened across3,928 theaters, of which 391 were IMAX. It made$5.5 million from Thursday previews from3,100 theaters, an improvement over its two immediate predecessors. Of that, the film grossed$1.1 million on 387 IMAX screens. This includes revenues generated from Wednesday night, when Paramount screened all Star Trek films, which concluded with a 10pm screening of Beyond. On its opening day, it earned$22.5 million, which is the second-biggest among the franchise, only behind Star Trek ($30.9 million), the third-biggest opening day of the summer for a live-action film and the second-biggest opening day of the year for anon-comic book superhero live-action film, behind only The Jungle Book. It earned$59.3 million in its opening weekend, which is the third-biggest debut among the franchise but the lowest of the reboot series (behind Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness for both). Adjusted for inflation, it ranks fourth behind the aforementioned films and Star Trek: First Contact ($60 million). It performed exceptionally well in IMAX making$8.7 million in 387 IMAX screens. The film came in 14% lower than the opening of its immediate predecessor, Star Trek Into Darkness, but box office experts noted that the fall was mild in comparison to other sequels of 2016 and is still considered a hit. It dropped precipitously by 69% on its second Friday and was overtaken by newcomer spy film Jason Bourne, earning$6.75 million. By comparison, Star Trek dropped 56% on its first Friday while Star Trek into Darkness fell 53%. However, this was not the worst Friday-to-Friday drop for a Star Trek film, as Star Trek: Nemesis plunged 83% on its second Friday due to negative word-of-mouth and heavy competition from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. By the second and third weekend following the film's release, box office revenue continued to drop significantly due to the release of competing films like Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad. Outside North america (edit) Internationally, the film received a scattered release pattern and was released across approximately 76 markets. It opened in 37 markets in conjunction with its North American release in its first weekend, including in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia--territories where the franchise has traditionally performed well. It earned a total of$30 million from the said number of markets which is slightly lower than Star Trek Into Darkness '$31.7 million international debut in 2013. Paramount said that the heatwave in Europe negatively impacted the weekend's results. Beyond debuted at first place in 16 of them and recorded the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 17 markets, including Russia, Taiwan and Thailand. It debuted in third place overall at the international box office, behind Skiptrace and The Legend of Tarzan. Beyond set numerous records in IMAX theaters. Led by very strong results in the UK and Russia, it grossed an estimated weekend of$3.2 million on 184 screens besting Star Trek Into Darkness '$2.8 million debut. In its second weekend, it fell drastically by 57% earning$13 million. As a result, it slipped into sixth place at the box office. After fluctuating up and down the charts, it finally topped the international box office in its seventh weekend due to a robust debut in China and remained at the top for the second weekend in a row. The highest international tallies were recorded in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($6.1 million), South Korea ($5.6 million), Germany ($4.5 million), Russia and the CIS ($3.3 million), Australia ($3 million), France ($2.1 million), Mexico ($1.5 million), Brazil ($1.6 million), Venezuela ($1.4 million) and Taiwan ($1 million). In the United Kingdom, where the performance of the franchise has been consistently solid, it was edged out by the family film The BFG. Its\u00a3 4.74 million ($6.2 million) opening from 535 theaters is the lowest among the rebooted series and a 31% decline from the\u00a3 8.43 million ($11 million) opening posted by Star Trek Into Darkness, if previews are deducted. The Guardian cited J.J. Abrams 'departure as the director and fans 'unenthusiastic response to Idris Elba as the villain (in comparison to Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness) as some possible reasons why the film failed to generate lucrative revenue. The site also projected a total gross of around\u00a3 20 million ($26million+) for the film. It opened in China on September 2, and earned an estimated$9.30 million on its opening day (representing 66% of the total marketplace), including$370,000 in midnight preview showings which is 160% larger than the opening day of Star Trek Into Darkness and$21.8 million in two days. In total, it had an opening weekend of$31.3 million (per Paramount) and$30.7 million (according to Chinese box office service Ent Group) from6,259 screens, marking the biggest Star Trek debut in country which is 105% bigger than the opening of Star Trek Into Darkness. It was the only one of five new releases to make any impression on the chart. It remained at the top of the box office for a second weekend by adding another$10.1 million (according to Chinese data provider Ent Group), or$11.37 million (according to Paramount) from5,830 locations from Friday to Sunday, a steep decline of 62.6% from its previous weekend. It fell out of the top 10 in its third weekend, and has grossed a total of$64.2 million there. It is projected the film will end its run there anywhere around$70--100 million, a disappointing figure considering the robust marketing effort by investors Alibaba Pictures and Huahua Media. Thus, the film is the second Paramount film to underperform in that corner following Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in July. In terms of total earnings, its biggest offshore markets are the United Kingdom ($13.3 million), Germany ($8.6 million), Russia and the CIS ($5.5 million) and Australia ($5.2 million). Star Trek Beyond opened in Japan on October 21, where it has earned$4.9 million as of 17 November 2016. Critical response (edit) On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 278 reviews, with an average rating of 7/ 10. The website's critical consensus reads, ``Star Trek Beyond continues the franchise'spost-reboot hot streak with an epic sci-fi adventure that honors the series 'sci-fi roots without skimping on the blockbuster action.'' On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating ``generally favorable reviews''. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ``A--'' on anA+ to F scale, down from the first two films '``A''. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and said, ``Even with its big-screen pyrotechnics and its feature-length running time, Star Trek Beyond plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes from the original series, and I mean that in the best possible way.'' Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film 8.4/ 10, describing it as being: ``terrific, a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern; Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series '50th anniversary.'' David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung ``injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration'', and went on by saying, ``While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling The Wrath of Khan as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life.'' Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: ``a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that's because it's basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn't take you to many new frontiers.'' Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond ``a somewhat diverting place holder, but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will have what it takes to boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before.'' Mark Hugues of Forbes said, ``Star Trek Beyond is the third-best Star Trek film of all time, creating the sort of emotional connection and familiar, powerful characterizations we loved in the original series while delivering top-notch action and the best Star Trek movie villain since First Contact's Borg Queen.'' Despite its international success, Star Trek Beyond was met by critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film11\u20442 stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers ``should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness.'' Smith later added, ``Beyond is tepid when it's trying to be emotional, moronic when it's trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it's trying to benon-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, Scott says it's impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip.'' James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave21\u20442 stars out of 4, writing: ``Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn't unexpected; it's Lin's trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg& Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it's also instantly forgettable.'' Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that ``Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered.'' Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film aC+ and wrote, ``(w) ith Beyond, it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent.''

In July 2016, Abrams confirmed plans for a fourth film and stated that Chris Hemsworth would return as Kirk's father, George, whom he played in the prologue of the first film. Later that month, Paramount confirmed the return of Hemsworth, as well as most of the Beyond cast, producers Abrams and Lindsey Weber, and writers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay. That same month, Abrams had said that Chekov would not be recast, after Anton Yelchin died in an accident outside his residence in California. In December 2017, it was revealed that Quentin Tarantino had pitched an idea for a potential Star Trek film to Abrams and Paramount, who were reportedly enthusiastic about the idea. Tarantino was mentioned as a possibility to direct the film if his schedule allowed, and that Abrams and Paramount would attempt to assemble a writer's room to explore the idea. On December 22, writer Mark L. Smith was hired by Paramount and Bad Robot to write a screenplay based on Tarantino's original pitch, with Tarantino still expected to direct. In April 2018, it was announced that two new Star Trek films are in development at Paramount. Later that month, it was announced that S.J. Clarkson will direct the second Star Trek film in development, and that the film will enter production before Tarantino's film. J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay willco-write the screenplay, while Abrams and Lindsey Weber willco-produce the project. In August 2018, however, Pine and Hemsworth walked away from negotiations to star in the film after refusing to take pay cuts as a result of Star Trek Beyond's underperformance.

It is a major meat in only a few countries, notably in Central Asia, but it forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many others, from Europe to South America to Asia. The top eight countries consume about 4.7 million horses a year. For the majority of humanity's early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein. It is slightly sweet, tender, and low in fat. Because of the role horses have played as companions and as workers, and ensuing concerns about the ethics of the horse slaughter process, it is a taboo food in some cultures. These historical associations, as well as ritual and religion, led to the development of an aversion to the consumption of horse meat. The horse is now given pet status by many in some parts of the Western world, particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland, which further solidifies the taboo on eating its meat.

In many parts of Europe, the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times, despite a papal ban of horse meat in 732. Horse meat was also eaten as part of Germanic pagan religious ceremonies in northern Europe, particularly ceremonies associated with the worship of Odin. Horses evolved on the North American continent, and by about12,000 years ago, migrated to other parts of the world, becoming extinct in the Americas. The Hagerman horse, about the size of a modern-day large pony, is one example, found in Idaho at the Hagerman Fossil Beds, a national monument. The Europeans 'horses that came over to the Americas with the Spaniards and followed by the settlers became feral, and were hunted by the indigenous Pehuenche people of what is now Chile and Argentina. At first, they hunted horses as they did other game, but later they began to raise them for meat and transport. The meat was, and still is, preserved by being sun-dried in the high Andes into a product known as charqui. France dates its taste for horse meat to the Revolution. With the fall of the aristocracy, its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence. Just as hairdressers and tailors set themselves up to serve commoners, the horses maintained by aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up alleviating the hunger of lower classes. During the Napoleonic campaigns, the surgeon-in-chief of Napoleon's Grand Army, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses. At the siege of Alexandria, the meat of young Arab horses relieved an epidemic of scurvy. At the battle of Eylau in 1807, Larrey served horse as soup and b\u0153uf \u00e0 la mode. At Aspern-Essling (1809), cut off from the supply lines, the cavalry used the breastplates of fallen cuirassiers as cooking pans and gunpowder as seasoning, and thus founded a tradition that carried on until at least the Waterloo campaign. Hunger during World War II led to horses being eaten. Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in French cuisine during the later years of the Second French Empire. The high cost of living in Paris prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as pork or beef, so in 1866, the French government legalized the eating of horse meat and the first butcher's shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices. During the Siege of Paris (1870--1871), horse meat, along with the meat from donkeys and mules, was eaten by anyone who could afford it, partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city, and also because horses were eating grain which was needed by the human populace. Though there were large numbers of horses in Paris (estimates suggested between65,000 and70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege) the supplies were ultimately limited. Not even champion racehorses were spared (even two horses presented to Napoleon III by Alexander II of Russia were slaughtered) but the meat soon became scarce. Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege, and after the war ended, horse meat remained popular. Likewise, in other places and times of siege or starvation, horses are viewed as a food source of last resort. Despite the general Anglophone taboo, horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain, especially in Yorkshire, until the 1930s, and in times of postwar food shortage surged in popularity in the United States and was considered for use in hospitals. A 2007 Time magazine article about horse meat brought in from Canada to the United States characterized the meat as sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, and closer to beef than venison. Taboo (edit) Attitude of various cultures (edit) Horse is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia. It is not a generally available food in some English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, the United States, and English Canada. It is also taboo in Brazil, Israel, and among the Romani people and Jewish people the world over. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, although the country exports horses both live animals and slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, and is illegal in some countries. For example, the Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of 'meat 'does not include horse. In Tonga, horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrees living in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have retained the taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them. In Islamic laws, consuming horse meat is Halal. The consumption of horse meat has been common in Central Asia societies, past or present, due to the abundance of steppes suitable for raising horses. In North Africa, horse meat has been occasionally consumed, but almost exclusively by the Christian Copts and the Hanafi Sunnis (a common form of Islam in Central Asia and Turkey), but has never been eaten in the Maghreb. Horse meat is forbidden by Jewish dietary laws because horses do not have cloven hooves and they are not ruminants. In the eighth century, Popes Gregory III and Zachary instructed Saint Boniface, missionary to the Germans, to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted, due to its association with Germanic pagan ceremonies. The people of Iceland allegedly expressed reluctance to embrace Christianity for some time, largely over the issue of giving up horse meat. Horse meat is now currently consumed in Iceland and many horses are raised for this purpose. The culturally close people of Sweden still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat, said to stem from this time. Henry Mayhew describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass in London and Paris in London Labour and the London Poor (1851). Horse meat was rejected by the British, but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany, where knackers often sold horse carcasses despite the papal ban. Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of Westphalia. Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages, and that offal sold as that of oxen was in fact equine. About1,000 horses were slaughtered a week. While no taboo on eating horse meat exists per se, it is generally considered by ethnic Russians to be a low-quality meat with poor taste, and it is rarely found in stores. It is popular among such peoples as Tatars, Yakuts, Kyrgyzs, and Kazakhs. Reasons for the taboo (edit) Further information: horse sacrifice In 732 AD, Pope Gregory III began a concerted effort to stop the ritual consumption of horse meat in pagan practice. In some countries, the effects of this prohibition by the Roman Catholic Church have lingered and horse meat prejudices have progressed from taboos, to avoidance, to abhorrence. In other parts of the world, horse meat has the stigma of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats, such as pork and beef. According to the anthropologist Marvin Harris, some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than ruminants. In a study conducted by Fred Simoons, the avoidance to horse meat in American culture is less likely due to lingering feelings from Gregory's prohibition and instead due to an unfamiliarity with the meat compared to more mainstream offerings. Totemistic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. Roman sources state that the goddess Epona was widely worshipped in Gaul and southern Britain. Epona, a triple-aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her; she was paralleled by the Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon. In The White Goddess, Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites. The Uffington White Horse is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifice (Ashwamedh Yaghya) as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana; but within context of the ritual sacrificial is not being 'killed 'but instead being smothered to death. In 1913, the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice. In ancient Scandinavia, the horse was very important, as a living, working creature, as a sign of the owner's status, and symbolically within the old Norse religion. Horses were slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts. When the Nordic countries were Christianized, eating horse meat was regarded as a sign of paganism and prohibited. A reluctance to eat horse meat is still common in these countries even today. Production (edit) Horse butcher on the Viktualienmarkt in Munich, Germany In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory slaughter houses (abattoirs) where they are stunned with a captive bolt gun and bled to death. In countries with a less industrialized food production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in the village where they will be consumed, or near to it. In 2005, the eight principal horse meat-producing countries produced over700,000 tonnes of this product.

In 2010, Mexico produced140,000 tonnes, China-126,000 tonnes, Kazakhstan-114,000 tonnes. As horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle, they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat. Instead, horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as riding or work animals is low, but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat, for example in the routine export of the southern English ponies from the New Forest, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. British law requires the use of ``equine passports'' even for semi wild horses to enable traceability (also known as ``provenance''), so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported, meaning that the animals travel as carcasses rather than live.Ex-racehorses, riding horses, and other horses sold at auction may also enter the food chain; sometimes these animals have been stolen or purchased under false pretenses. Even prestigious horses may end up in the slaughterhouse; the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner and 1987 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner, Ferdinand, is believed to have been slaughtered in Japan, probably for pet food. A misconception exists that horses are commonly slaughtered for pet food, however. In many countries, such as the United States, horse meat was outlawed in pet food in the 1970s. American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan, and its cost is in line with veal, so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food. The British newspaper The Daily Mail reports that every year,100,000 live horses are transported into and around the European Union for human consumption, mainly to Italy, but also to France and Belgium. Meat from horses that veterinarians have put down with a lethal injection is not suitable for human consumption, as the toxin remains in the meat; the carcasses of such animals are sometimes cremated (most other means of disposal are problematic, due to the toxin). Remains of euthanized animals can be rendered, which maintains the value of the skin, bones, fats, etc., for such purposes as fish food. This is commonly done for lab specimens (e.g., pigs) euthanized by injection. The amount of drug (e.g. a barbiturate) is insignificant after rendering. Carcasses of horses treated with some drugs are considered edible in some jurisdictions. For example, according to Canadian regulation, hyaluron, used in treatment of particular disorders in horses, in HY-50 preparation, should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat. In Europe, however, the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect, and edibility of the horse meat is not affected. Opposition to production (edit) Main article: Horse slaughter The killing of horses for human consumption is widely opposed in countries such as the U.S., UK and Australia. where horses are generally considered to be companion and sporting animals only. Almost all equine medications and treatments are labeled as being not intended for human consumption. In the European Union, horses intended for slaughter can not be treated with many medications commonly used for U.S. horses. For horses going to slaughter, no period of withdrawal, the time between administration of the drug and the time they are butchered, is required. French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat. However, the opposition is far from unanimous; a 2007 readers 'poll in the London magazine Time Out showed that 82% of respondents supported chef Gordon Ramsay's decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants.

Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color, while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most mammals. Horse meat can be used to replace beef, pork, mutton, venison, and any other meat in virtually any recipe. Horse meat is usually very lean. Jurisdictions which allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions, so many are quite old. Those preparing sandwiches or cold meals with horse meat usually use it smoked and salted. It forms an ingredient in several traditional recipes of salami. In various countries (edit) In 2009, a British agriculture industry website reported these horse meat production levels in various countries: Horse meat production levels as of 2009 Country Tons per year Mexico78,000 Argentina57,000 Kazakhstan55,000 Mongolia38,000 Kyrgyzstan25,000 Australia24,000 Brazil21,000 Canada18,000 Poland18,000 Italy16,000* Romania14,000 Chile10,000 France7,500 Uruguay8,000 Senegal9,500 Colombia6,000 Spain5,000** Including donkeys. Asia-pacific (edit) Australia (edit) Australians do not generally eat horse meat, although they have a horse slaughter industry that exports to Japan, Europe, and Russia. Horse meat exports peaked at9,327 tons 1986, declining to3,000 tons in 2003. They are at Peterborough in South Australia (SAMEX Peterborough Pty Ltd) and Caboolture Abattoir in Queensland (Meramist Pty Ltd). A British agriculture industry website reported that Australian horse meat production levels had risen to24,000 tons by 2009. On 30 June 2010, Western Australian Agriculture Minister Terry Redman granted final approval to Western Australia butcher Vince Garreffa to sell horse meat for human consumption. Nedlands restaurateur Pierre Ichallalene announced plans to do a taster on Bastille Day and to put horse meat dishes on the menu if the reaction is good. Mr. Redman said that the government would ``consider extending approvals should the public appetite for horse demand it''. Mr. Garreffa is the owner of Mondo Di Carne, a major wholesale meat supplier which supplies many cafes, restaurants, and hotels in Western Australia. He commented that no domestic market exists for horse meat, but a successful export market exists, of which he believes Western Australia should have a share. This decision caused outrage amongst some groups, limited reaction from many, and enthusiasm from others. Several local newspaper forums indicated that the general public were not greatly biased either way, in fact many voiced their openness for alternative meats. Horse meat consumption has continued as a niche market in Australia, with further potential for growth as gourmet interests develop. China (edit) See also: Chinese cuisine Although it is generally acceptable to Chinese people, outside of specific areas such as Guilin in Guangxi or in Yunnan Province, horse meat is not popular due to its low availability and rumors that horse meat tastes bad or it is bad for health. Because the Compendium of Materia Medica written during the Ming dynasty by Li Shizhen indicates that horse meat is poisonous and may cause folliculitis or death. The Compendium of Materia Medica also asserts, ``To relieve toxin caused by eating horse meat, one can drink Phragmites root jouce and eat apricot kernel.'' Today, in southern China, locally famous dishes include horse meat rice noodles (\u9a6c \u8089 \u7c73\u7c89; Pinyin: m\u01cer\u00f2u m\u01d0f\u011bn) in Guilin and horse meat hot pot (\u9a6c \u8089 \u706b\u9505; Pinyin: m\u01cer\u00f2u hu\u01d2gu\u014d) in Huishui County in Guizhou Province. Indonesia (edit) See also: Indonesian cuisine Sate kuda, horse satay served in Yogyakarta, Indonesia In Indonesia, one type of satay (chunks of skewered grilled meat served with spicy sauce) known as horse satay (Javanese: sate jaran, Indonesian: sate kuda) is made from horse meat. This delicacy from Yogyakarta is served with sliced fresh shallot, pepper, and sweet soy sauce. Japan (edit) See also: Japanese cuisine Basashi from Kumamoto Sakura nabe In Japanese cuisine, raw horse meat is called sakura (\u685c) or sakuraniku (\u685c \u8089, sakura means cherry blossom, niku means meat) because of its pink color. It can be served raw as sashimi in thin slices dipped in soy sauce, often with ginger and onions added. In this case, it is called basashi (\u99ac\u523a\u3057). Basashi is popular in some regions of Japan and is often served at izakaya bars. Fat, typically from the neck, is also found as basashi, though it is white, not pink. Horse meat is also sometimes found on menus for yakiniku (a type of barbecue), where it is called baniku (\u99ac\u8089, literally ``horse meat'') or bagushi (\u99ac \u4e32, ``skewered horse''); thin slices of raw horse meat are sometimes served wrapped in a shiso leaf. Kumamoto, Nagano, and \u014cita are famous for basashi, and it is common in the T\u014dhoku region, as well. Some types of canned ``corned meat'' in Japan include horse as one of the ingredients. Aside raising local draft horses for meat, Japan imports living horses (from Canada) and meat from several countries-five largest are Canada, Mexico, Italy, Argentina and Brazil. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (edit) See also: Kazakh cuisine and Kyrgyz cuisine In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, horse meat is a large part of the diet, due mainly to the nomadic roots of the population. Some of the dishes include sausages called kazy and chuchuk or shuzhyk made from the meat using the guts as the sausage skin, zhaya made from hip meat which is smoked and boiled, jal (or zhal) made from neck fat which is smoked and boiled, karta made from a section of the rectum which is smoked and boiled, and sur-et which is kept as dried meat. Mongolia (edit) See also: Mongolian cuisine Salted horse meat sausages called kazy are produced as a regional delicacy by the Kazakhs. Generally, Mongols prefer beef and mutton (though during the extremely cold Mongolian winter, some people prefer horse meat due to its low cholesterol). It is kept unfrozen, and traditionally people think horse meat helps warm them up. Other Asian nations import processed horse meat from Mongolia. Philippines (edit) In the Philippines, horse meat (lukba, tapang kabayo, or kabayo) is a delicacy commonly sold in wet markets. The method of preparation is very common which includes marinating the meat in calamansi or lemon juice, toyo (soy sauce), and pat\u00eds (fish sauce). It is then fried and served, and often dipped into vinegar to give the meat a tart flavour. South Korea (edit) Further information: Korean cuisine Malgogi-yukhoe (horse meat tartare) In South Korea, horse meat is generally not eaten, but raw horse meat, usually around the neck part, is consumed as a delicacy on Jeju Island. It is usually seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil. Tonga (edit) This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In Tonga, horsemeat orlo'iho'osi is much more than just a delicacy; the consumption of horsemeat is generally only reserved for special occasions. These special occasions may include the death of an important family member or community member or as a form of celebration during the birthday of an important family member or perhaps the visitation of someone important, such as the King of Tonga. In Tonga, a horse is one of the most valuable animals a family can own because of its use as a beast of burden. Tonga has long lacked land area compared with its population so the missionaries introduced horsemeat in lieu of cattle. Therefore, the slaughter of one's horse for consumption becomes a moment of immense homage to the person or event for which the horse was slain. Despite a diaspora into Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and New Zealand, where consumption of horsemeat is generally taboo, Tongans still practice the consumption of horse meat perhaps even more so because it is more readily available and more affordable. Europe (edit) A horse meat steak served at restaurant Oklahoma, Vantaa, Finland In 2013, horse meat and traces of horse DNA were found in some food products where horse was not labelled as an ingredient, sparking the 2013 meat adulteration scandal across Europe. Austria (edit) See also: Austrian cuisine Fast food shop selling horse Leberk\u00e4se (Pferdeleberk\u00e4se) in Vienna Horse Leberk\u00e4se is available in special horse butcheries and occasionally at various stands, sold in a bread roll. Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach, or Tyrolean Grauk\u00e4se (a sour milk cheese). They are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side dish. Belgium (edit) See also: Belgian cuisine In Belgium, horse meat (paardenvlees in Dutch and viande chevaline in French) is popular in a number of preparations. Lean, smoked, and sliced horse meat fillet (paardenrookvlees or paardengerookt; filet chevalin in French) is served as a cold cut with sandwiches or as part of a cold salad. Horse steaks can be found in most butchers and are used in a variety of preparations. The city of Vilvoorde has a few restaurants specialising in dishes prepared with horse meat. Horse sausage is a well-known local specialty in Lokeren with European recognition. Smoked or dried horse/ pork meat sausage, similar to salami, is sold in a square shape to be distinguished from pork and/ or beef sausages. A Flemish region around the Rupel river is also famous for a horse stew named 'Schep ', made out of shoulder chuck (or similar cuts), brown ale, onions and mustard. Schep is typically served with French fries, mayonnaise and a salad of raw Belgian endive. Bulgaria (edit) See also: Bulgarian cuisine Horse meat is served in some restaurants in Bulgaria, as the preferred way of consuming it is in the form of steaks and burgers. Still being far from a meat for mass consumption, horse beef isre-gaining its popularity, which it had in the 60s and 70s of the past century, when it was also consumed in sausages and tartares. France (edit) Contrefilet of horse meat, in France A butcher shop specializing in horse meat in Pezenas, Languedoc, France See also: French cuisine In France, specialized butcher shops (boucheries chevalines) sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops were for a long time forbidden to deal in it. However, since the 1990s, it can be found in supermarket butcher shops and others. Horse meat was famously eaten in large amounts during the 1870 Siege of Paris, when it was included in haute cuisine menus. Germany (edit) See also: German cuisine In Germany horse meat is sold by specialized butchers (Pferdemetzgereien) and by mail order. Many regions of Germany have traditional recipes that include horse meat. In the Rhineland around Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf it is still common for restaurants to offer the traditional Sauerbraten in horse meat and beef variants. Other traditional horse meat dishes include the Swabian Pferderostbraten (a joint of roast meat prepared similarly to roast beef), Bavarian sausage varieties such as Rosswurst and Ross-Kochsalami as well as Ross-Leberk\u00e4se, a meatloaf dish. The 2013 meat adulteration scandal started when German authorities detected horse meat in prepared food products including frozen lasagna, where it was declared fraudulently as beef. The mislabeling prompted EU authorities to speed up publication of European Commission recommendations for labeling the origin of all processed meat. Hungary (edit) See also: Hungarian cuisine In Hungary, horse meat is primarily used in salami and sausages, usually mixed with pork, but also in goulashes and other stews. These products are sold in most supermarkets and many butcher shops. Iceland (edit) See also: Cuisine of Iceland In Iceland, it is both eaten minced and as steak, also used in stews and fondue, prized for its strong flavor. It has a particular role in the culture and history of the island. The people of Iceland supposedly were reluctant to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat after Pope Gregory III banned horse meat consumption in 732 AD, as it was a major part of many pagan rites and sacrifice in Northern Europe. Horse meat consumption was banned when the pagan Norse Icelanders eventually adopted Christianity in the year 1000. The ban became so ingrained that most people would not handle horse meat let alone consume it. Even during harsh famines in the 18th Century most people would not eat horse meat, and those who did were castigated. In 1757 the ban was decriminalised, but general distaste for horse meat lasted well into the 19th Century, possibly longer and its consumption often regarded as an indication of poverty. Even today horse meat is not popular (3.2% of Iceland's meat production in 2015), although this has more to do with culinary tradition and the popularity of equestrianism than any religious vestiges. Italy (edit) Venetian horse meat butcher See also: Italian cuisine Horse meat is especially popular in Lombardia, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/ S\u00fcdtirol, Parma, Apulia, and the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. Horse meat is used in a variety of recipes: as a stew called pastissada (typical of Verona), served as steaks, as carpaccio, or made into bresaola. Thin strips of horse meat called sfilacci are popular. Horse fat is used in recipes such as pezzetti di cavallo. Horse meat sausages and salamis are traditional in various places. In Sardinia, sa petza 'e cuaddu or sa petha (d) e caddu (campidanese and logudorese for horse meat) is one of the most renowned meats and sometimes is sold in typical kiosks with bread-also in the town of Sassari is a long tradition of eating horse steaks (carri di cabaddu in the local dialect). Chefs and consumers tend to prize its uniqueness by serving it as rare as possible. Donkey is also cooked, for example as a stew called stracottod'asino and as meat for sausages e.g. mortadellad'asino. The cuisine of Parma features a horsemeat tartare called pesto di cavallo, as well as various cooked dishes. In Veneto, the consumption of horse meat dates back to at least 1000 BC to the Adriatic Veneti, renowned for their horse-breeding skills. They were used to sacrifice horses to their goddess Reitia or to the mythical hero Diomedes. Throughout the classical period, Veneto established itself as a centre for horse breeding in Italy; Venetian horses were provided for the cavalry and carriage of the Roman legions, with the white Venetic horses becoming famous among Greeks and Romans as one of the best breeds for circus racing. As well as breeding horses for military and farming applications, the Venetics also used them for consumption throughout the Roman period, a practice that established the consumption of horse meat as a tradition in Venetian cuisine. In the modern age, horse meat is considered a luxury item and is widely available through supermarkets and butcheries, with some specialised butcheries offering only selected cuts of equine meat. Prices are usually higher than beef, pork, or any other kind of meat, except game. Typical Paduan specialty: horse sfilacci In the Province of Padua, horse meat is a key element of the local cuisine, particularly in the area that extends southeast from the city, historically called Saccisica. Specialties based on horse meat constitute the main courses and best attractions of several typical restaurants in the zone. They are also served among other regional delicacies at the food stands of many local festivals, related to civil and religious anniversaries. Most notable is the Festa del Cavallo, held annually in the small town of Legnaro and totally dedicated to horses, included their consumption for food. Some traditional dishes are: Sfilacci di cavallo: tiny frayings of horse meat, dried and seasoned; to be consumed raw, can be a light and quick snack, more popular as a topping on other dishes: ex. pasta, risotto, pizza, salads, etc. Cav\u00e0eo in Umido (traditional horsemeat stew from Padua) with grilled polenta Stra\u00e9ca: a thin soft horse steak, cut from the diaphragm, variously cooked and dressed on the grill, pan or hot-plate Bistecca di puledro colt steak, whose preparation is similar to stra\u00e9ca Spezzatino di cavallo also said cav\u00e0eo in umido, small chunks of horse meat, stewed with onion, parsley and/ or other herbs and flavours, potatoes, broth, wine, etc., usually consumed with polenta, much appreciated also is a similar stew made of donkey meat, served in traditional trattorie, with many variations for different villages: spessadin de musso, musso in umido, musso in tocio, musso in pocio Prosciutto di cavallo: horse ham, served in very thin slices Salame di cavallo or salsiccia di cavallo: various kinds of salami, variously produced or seasoned, sometimes made of pure equine meat, sometimes mixed with others (beef or pork) Bigoli al sugo di cavallo: a typical form of fresh pasta, similar to thick rough spaghetti, dressed with sauce like Bolognese sauce, but made with minced horse meat Pezzetti di cavallo al sugo: horse stew, seasoned with sauce, vegetables and various peperocino, widely used in the Salento Chunks (pezzetti) of horse stew (spezzatino di cavallo) In southern Italy, horse meat is commonly eaten everywhere-especially in the region of Apulia, where it is considered a delicacy. It is often a vital part of the rag\u00f9 barese ((ra\u02c8\u0261u ba\u02c8re\u02d0ze)) in Bari. According to British food writer Matthew Fort, ``The taste for donkey and horse goes back to the days when these animals were part of everyday agricultural life. In the frugal, unsentimental manner of agricultural communities, all the animals were looked on as a source of protein. Waste was not an option.'' Malta (edit) See also: Maltese cuisine In Malta, horse meat (Maltese: La\u0127am ta\u017c-\u017ciemel) is seared and slowly cooked for hours in either tomato or red wine sauce. A few horse meat shops still exist and it is still served in some restaurants. Netherlands (edit) See also: Dutch cuisine Horse meat from the Netherlands In the Netherlands, smoked horse meat (paardenrookvlees) is sold as sliced meat and eaten on bread. Zuurvlees, a southern Dutch stew, is made with horse meat as main ingredient. There are also beef-based variants. Horse meat is also used in sausages (paardenworst and frikandel), fried fast food snacks and ready-to-eat soups. Norway (edit) See also: Norwegian cuisine In Norway, horse meat is commonly used in cured meats, such as vossakorv and svartp\u00f8lse, and less commonly as steak, hestebiff. Inpre-Christian Norway, horse was seen as an expensive animal. To eat a horse was to show one had great wealth, and to sacrifice a horse to the gods was seen as the greatest gift one could give. When Norwegians adopted Christianity, horse-eating became taboo as it was a religious act for pagans, thus it was considered a sign of heresy. Poland (edit) See also: Polish cuisine Live, old horses are often exported to Italy to be slaughtered. This practice also garners controversy. Horses in Poland are treated mostly as companions and the majority of society is against the live export to Italy. However, in Poland there exists a tradition of eating horse meat (sausage or tartare steaks). The consumption of horse meat was the biggest in the times when other meat was scarce (in the 20th century: WWII and the communist period). Serbia (edit) See also: Serbian cuisine Horse meat is generally available in Serbia, though mostly shunned in traditional cuisine. It is, however, often recommended by general practitioners to persons who suffer from anemia. It is available to buy at three green markets in Belgrade, a market in Ni\u0161, and in several cities in ethnically mixed Vojvodina, where Hungarian and previously German traditions brought the usage. Slovenia (edit) See also: Slovenian cuisine A horse meat hamburger in restaurant Hot 'Horse, Ljubljana, Slovenia: Horse meat is a national delicacy in Slovenia. Horse meat is generally available in Slovenia, and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine, especially in the central region of Carniola and in the Karst region. Colt steak (\u017erebi\u010dkov zrezek) is also highly popular, especially in Slovenia's capital Ljubljana, where it is part of the city's traditional regional cuisine. In Ljubljana, many restaurants sell burgers and meat that contain large amounts of horse meat, including a fast-food chain called Hot 'Horse. Spain (edit) See also: Spanish cuisine Cecina is cured meat made from beef or horse, and it is considered as a delicacy. Foal meat (carne de potro) is preferred rather than horse meat, and it is easy to find in supermarkets and usually prepared as stew or steak. It is a common practice to give it to children with anemia. Although no generalized taboo exists in Spain, its consumption is minor compared to pork, beef, and lamb. Sweden (edit) See also: Swedish cuisine Smoked/ cured horse meat is widely available as a cold cut under the name hamburgerk\u00f6tt (literally hamburgermeat). It tends to be very thinly sliced and fairly salty, slightly reminiscent of deli-style ham and, as a packaged meat, may list horsemeat (as h\u00e4stk\u00f6tt) as its primary ingredient. Several varieties of smoked sausages made from horse meat including Gustafskorv are also quite popular, especially in the province of Dalarna, where it is made. It is similar to salami or metworst and is used as an alternative to them on sandwiches. It is also possible to order horse beef from some well-stocked grocery stores. Switzerland (edit) See also: Swiss cuisine The ordinance on foodstuffs of animal origin in Switzerland explicitly lists equines as an animal species allowed for the production of food. Horse steak is modestly common. A speciality known as Mostbr\u00f6ckli is made with beef or horse meat. It is also used for a range of sausages in the German-speaking north of Switzerland. Like in northern Italy, in the Italian-speaking south, local salametti (sausages) are sometimes made with horse meat. It may also be used in fondue Bourguignonne. United Kingdom (edit) See also: British cuisine and 2013 meat adulteration scandal In the United Kingdom, the slaughter, preparation, and consumption of horses for food is not against the law, although it has been rare since the 1930s and it is not generally available. There is a cultural taboo against consuming horse meat in the UK, although it was eaten when other meats were scarce, such as during times of war (as was whale meat, which was never popular in Britain). The sale of meat labelled as horse meat in supermarkets and butchers is minimal, and most of the properly described horse meat consumed in the UK is imported from Europe, predominantly the south of France, where it is more widely available. Horse meat may be eaten without the knowledge of the consumer, due to accidental or fraudulent introduction of horse meat into human food. A 2003 Food Standards Agency (FSA) investigation revealed that certain sausages, salami and similar products such as chorizo and pastrami sometimes contain horse meat without it being listed, although listing is legally required. The 2013 horse meat scandal involved multiple products being recalled from shelves due to unlabelled horse meat in amounts up to 100% of the meat content. The issue came to light on 15 January 2013, when it was reported that horse DNA had been discovered in frozen beefburgers sold in several Irish and British supermarkets. Horse meat was featured in a segment in a 2007 episode of the Gordon Ramsay series The F Word. In the segment, Janet Street-Porter convinced locals to try horse meat, though not before facing controversy and being forced to move her stand to a privately owned location. The meat was presented as having a similar taste to beef, but with less fat, a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acid and a safer alternative in times of worry regarding bird flu and mad cow disease. The segment was met with skepticism from many after broadcast for various reasons, either because some felt the practice was cruel and against social norms, or simply a belief that if the taste was really on par with other meats, then people would already be eating it. Ukraine (edit) In Ukraine, especially in Crimea and other southern steppe regions, horse meat is consumed in the form of sausages called mahan and sudzhuk. These particular sausages are traditional food of the Crimean Tatar population. North America (edit) Canada (edit) See also: Canadian cuisine A thriving horse meat business exists in Quebec; the meat is available in most supermarket chains there. Horse meat is also for sale at the other end of the country, in Granville Island Market in downtown Vancouver, where according to a Time magazine reviewer who smuggled it into the United States, it turned out to be a ``sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, closer to beef than venison''. Horse meat is also available in high-end Toronto butchers and supermarkets. Aside from the heritage of French cuisine at one end of the country, most of Canada shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the English-speaking world. This mentality is especially evident in Alberta, where strong horse racing and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province's founding, although large numbers of horses are slaughtered for meat in Fort MacLeod, and certain butchers in Calgary do sell it. The consumer protection show Kassensturz of Swiss television SRF together with Tier Schutz Bund, Z\u00fcrich, reported on 19 February 2013 the bad treatment and brutal animal husbandry in Canadian horse meat farms in Fort MacLeod, Alberta, consequently the import from such farms has been boycotted. CBC News reported on March 10, 2013, that horse meat was also popular among some segments of Toronto's population. United States (edit) See also: Horse slaughter\u00a7 United States Horse meat is generally not eaten in the United States and holds a taboo in American culture which is very similar to the one found in the United Kingdom. All horse meat produced in the United States (up until the last quarter of 2007) was intended solely for export abroad, primarily to the European Union. A thriving horse exportation business is going on in several states, including Texas, mainly exporting horses to slaughterhouses in either Canada or Mexico. Restriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U.S. has generally involved legislation at local, state, and federal levels. Several states enacted legislation either prohibiting the sale of horse meat or banning altogether the slaughter of horses. California Proposition 6 (1998) was passed by state voters, outlawing the possession, transfer, reception, or holding any horse, pony, burro, or mule by a person who is aware that it will be used for human consumption, and making the slaughter of horses or the sale of horsemeat for human consumption a misdemeanor offense. In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly enacted Public Act 95-02, ameding Chapter 225, Section 635 of the state's compiled statutes to prohibit both the act of slaughtering equines for human consumption as well as the trade of any horse meat similarly to Texas Agriculture Code's Chapter 149. Other states banning horse slaughter or the sale of horse meat include New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. In addition, several other states introduced legislation to outlaw the practice over the years, such as Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York. At the federal level, since 2001 several bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate to ban horse slaughter throughout the country without success. However, a budgetary provision banning the use of federal funds to carry out mandatory inspections at horse slaughter plants (necessary to allow interstate sale and exports of horse meat) has also been in place since 2007. This restriction was temporarily removed in 2011 as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012 but was again included in the FY2014 Agriculture Appropriations Act and subsequent federal budgets, hence preventing the operation of any domestic horse slaughter operation. Until 2007, only three horse meat slaughterhouses still existed in the United States for export to foreign markets, but they were closed by court orders resulting from the upholding of aforementioned Illinois and Texas statutes banning horse slaughter and the sale of horse meat. The taboo surrounding horse meat in the United States received national attention again in May 2017 when a restaurant in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh served a dish containing horse tartare as part of a special event the restaurant was hosting with French Canadian chefs as guests. The restaurant, which otherwise does not serve horse meat (which is legal to serve and consume in Pennsylvania), received an inspection and a warning from the USDA not to serve horse meat again. A Change.org petition subsequently went up to advocate making serving horse meat illegal in Pennsylvania. From the 1920s and through the 1950s or 1960s, and with a brief rationing hiccup during WWII, horse meat was canned and sold as dog food by many different companies under many different brands, most notably by Ken-L Ration. The popularity of horse meat as dog food became so popular that by the 1930s over50,000 horses were bred and slaughtered each year to keep up with this specific demand. Mexico (edit) As of 2005, Mexico was the second largest producer of horse meat in the world. By 2009, it became the largest producer of horse meat in the world. It is only exported as it is not used or consumed in Mexico. South America (edit) Chile (edit) See also: Chilean cuisine In Chile, it is used in charqui. Also in Chile, horse meat became the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes, which promptly switched from a guanaco-based economy to a horse-based one after the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral. This applied specially to the Pampa and Mapuche nations, who became fierce horseman warriors. Similar to the Tatars, they ate raw horse meat and milked their animals. Although not nearly as common as beef meat, horse meat can be readily available in some butcheries throughout the country. It is generally less expensive than beef and somewhat associated with lower social strata. Colombia (edit) In Colombia, eating horse meat is considered taboo. Argentina (edit) Argentina is a producer and exporter of horse meat, but it is not used in local consumption and is considered taboo. Venezuela (edit) In Venezuela, eating horse meat is considered taboo.

Bayes illustration, 1889 Author Hans Christian Andersen Original title ``Den Lille Pige med Svovlstikkerne'' Country Denmark Language Danish Genre (s) Short story Published in Dansk Folkekalender for 1846 Publication date December 1845 ``The Little Match Girl'' (Danish: Den Lille Pige med Svovlstikkerne, meaning ``The little girl with the matchsticks'') is a short story by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen. The story, about a dying child's dreams and hope, was first published in 1845. It has been adapted to various media, including an animated short film, a television musical, and an animated virtual reality story called ``Allumette''.

She is already shivering from cold and early hypothermia, and she is walking barefoot having lost her two large slippers. Still, she is too afraid to go home, because her father will beat her for not selling any matches, and also as the many cracks in their shack can't keep out the cold wind. The girl takes shelter in a nook or alley and sits down. The girl lights the matches to warm herself. In their glow she sees several lovely visions, starting with a warm stove, then a luxurious holiday feast where the goose almost jumps out at her, and then a magnificent Christmas tree larger than the one at the rich merchant's house. The girl looks skyward and sees a shooting star; she then remembers her late grandmother saying that such a falling star means someone is dying and is going to Heaven. As she lights the next match, she sees a vision of her grandmother, the only person to have treated her with love and kindness all through her life. To keep the vision of her grandmother alive for as long as she can, the girl lights the entire bundle of matches at once. After running out of matches the child dies and her grandmother carries her soul to Heaven. The next morning, passers-by find the girl dead in the nook, frozen with a smile on her face, and guess the reason for the burnt-out matches beside her. They feel pity for her, although they had not shown kindness to her before her death. They have no way of knowing about the wonderful visions she saw before her death or how gloriously she is celebrating the New Year in Heaven with her grandmother.

For the practice, now considered pseudoscientific, of examining a handwriting exemplar to determine one or more psychological traits of the person providing it, see Graphology. In forensic science, questioned document examination (QDE) is the examination of documents potentially disputed in a court of law. Its primary purpose is to provide evidence about a suspicious or questionable document using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court.

The most common type of examination involves handwriting wherein the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship. A document examiner is often asked to determine if a questioned item originated from the same source as the known item (s), then present their opinion on the matter in court as an expert witness. Other common tasks include determining what has happened to a document, determining when a document was produced, or deciphering information on the document that has been obscured, obliterated, or erased. The discipline is known by many names including 'forensic document examination ', 'document examination ', 'diplomatics ', 'handwriting examination ', or sometimes 'handwriting analysis ', although the latter term is not often used as it may be confused with graphology. Likewise a forensic document examiner (FDE) is not to be confused with a graphologist, and vice versa. Many FDEs receive extensive training in all of the aspects of the discipline. As a result, they are competent to address a wide variety of questions about document evidence. However, this ``broad specialization'' approach has not been universally adopted. In some locales, a clear distinction is made between the terms 'forensic document examiner 'and a 'forensic handwriting expert/ examiner '. In such cases, the former term refers to examiners who focus onnon-handwriting examination types while the latter refers to those trained exclusively to do handwriting examinations. Even in places where the more general meaning is common, such as North America or Australia, there are many individuals who have specialized training only in relatively limited areas. As the terminology varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is important to clarify the meaning of the title used by any individual professing to be a ``forensic document examiner''. Scope of document examination (edit) A forensic document examiner is intimately linked to the legal system as a forensic scientist. Forensic science is the application of science to address issues under consideration in the legal system. FDEs examine items (documents) that form part of a case that may or may not come before a court of law. Common criminal charges involved in a document examination case fall into the ``white-collar crime'' category. These include identity theft, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, or uttering a forged document. Questioned documents are often important in other contexts simply because documents are used in so many contexts and for so many purposes. For example, a person may commit murder and forge a suicide note. This is an example where a document is produced directly as a fundamental part of a crime. More often a questioned document is simply the by-product of normal day-to-day business or personal activities. The American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM) publishes standards for many methods and procedures used by FDEs. E30. 02 was the ASTM subcomittee for Questioned Documents. These guides were under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30. 02 on Questioned Documents. The ASTM Questioned Document Section has been disbanded. All of the Standards are now available through SWGDOC (The Scientific Working Group for Document Examiners). The Standard Guide for Scope of Work of Forensic Document Examiners indicates there are four components to the work of a forensic document examiner. It states that an examiner ``makes scientific examinations, comparisons, and analyses of documents to: establish genuineness or nongenuineness, or to expose forgery, or to reveal alterations, additions or deletions; identify or eliminate persons as the source of handwriting; identify or eliminate the source of typewriting or other impression, marks, or relative evidence; and write reports or give testimony, when needed, to aid the users of the examiner's services in understanding the examiner's findings.'' Some FDEs limit their work to the examination and comparison of handwriting; most inspect and examine the whole document in accordance with this ASTM standard. Types of document examined (edit) Documents feature prominently in all manner of business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be a sheet of paper bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document '. FDEs define the word ``document'' in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others. Historical cases (edit) The National Archives forgeries (aka Martin Allen forgeries or Himmler forged documents) (2005) The Killian memos (2004) The ImClone/ Martha Stewart trial (2004) The Yellowcake Forgery (2003) The Nina Wang case of the Teddy Wang wills (2002 and 2010) The anthrax attack mailings on the US Senate (2001) The JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey murder (1996) The Paul Jennings Hill murders (1994) The Hitler Diaries printed by the magazine Stern and determined to be forgeries (1983) The Mark Hofmann forgeries and murders (1980--84) The Mormon Will that Melvin Dummar claimed left him part of Howard Hughes 'fortune (1978) The Clifford Irving claim that Howard Hughes authorized his biography (1972) The Zodiac Killer (1969) The Lindbergh kidnapping (1934) where comparison of the ransom note and Bruno Hauptmann's handwriting was crucial The Adolf Beck cases (1896 and 1904) where handwriting expert Thomas H. Gurrin repeated an erroneous identification The James Reavis (Baron of Arizona) land swindle trial about forged documents involved in a Spanish barony and land grant (1895) The Dreyfus Affair (1894), involvingnon-FDE Alphonse Bertillon, although professional comparisons exonerating Dreyfus were ignored The Howland will forgery trial (1868) Operation Bernhard, a secret Nazi plan to destabilize the British economy through counterfeited banknotes (1939) Although the crimes were committed before the discipline of document examination was firmly established, the letters of the Jack the Ripper case have since been examined in great detail. Candidacy (edit) A person who desires to enter a career of forensic document examination must possess certain traits and abilities. The ASTM Standard E2388-05 (Standard Guide for Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners) lists several requirements for the ``Trainee Candidate''. First and foremost, ``an earned baccalaureate degree or equivalent from an accredited college or university'' is required as it gives the aspirant a scientific background with which to approach the work in an objective manner, as well as bestowing necessary biological, physical, and chemical knowledge sometimes called upon in the work. Second, excellent eyesight is required to see fine details that are otherwise inconspicuous. To this end, the aspirant must successfully complete: a form discrimination test to ensure that the aspirant is able to tell apart two similar-appearing yet different items, a color perception test, and near and distant visual acuity tests ``with best corrected vision within six months prior to commencement of training.'' Beyond the above, additional desirable skills include knowledge of paper, ink, printing processes, or handwriting. Training (edit) There are three possible methods of instruction for an aspiring document examiner: Self-education is the way the pioneers of the field began, as there was no other method of instruction. Apprenticeship has become the widespread way many examiners are now taught. This is the method that is recommended by ASTM in Standard E2388-05. To conform with the ASTM standard such training ``shall be the equivalent of a minimum of 24 months full-time training under the supervision of a principal trainer'' and ``the training program shall be successfully completed in a period not to exceed four years''. The training program must also include an extensive list of specific syllabus topics outlined in ASTM Standard E2388-05. College and university programs are very limited. This is due, in part, to the relatively limited demand for forensic document examiners. It also relates to the need for extensive practical experience, particularly with respect to handwriting examination. It is difficult to include this degree of practical experience in a normal academic program. There are some distance learning courses available as well. These are taught through a virtual reality classroom and may include an apprenticeship program, a correspondence course, or both. A trainee must learn how to present evidence before the court in clear, forceful testimony. Fledgling examiners in the later stages of training can get a glimpse into the legal process as well as a better sense of this aspect of their work through participation in a mock trial or by attending court hearings to observe the testimony of qualified examiners. These are guidelines and not requirements. Examination (edit) Examination types (edit) Examinations and comparisons conducted by document examiners can be diverse and may involve any of the following: Handwriting (cursive/ printing) and signatures Typewriters, photocopiers, laser printers, ink-jet printers, fax machines Chequewriters, rubber stamps, price markers, label makers Printing processes Ink, pencil, paper Alterations, additions, erasures, obliterations Indentation detection and/ or decipherment Sequence determination Physical matching Principle of identification (edit) The concept of 'identification 'as it is applied in the forensic sciences is open to discussion and debate. Nonetheless, the traditional approach in the discipline of forensic document examination is best expressed as follows: ``When any two items possess a combination of independent discriminating elements (characteristics) that are similar and/ or correspond in their relationships to one another, of such number and significance as to preclude the possibility of their occurrence by pure coincidence, and there are no inexplicable disparities, it may be concluded that they are the same in nature or are related to a common source (the principle of identification).'' The evaluation of such characteristics is now predominantly subjective though efforts to meaningfully quantify this type of information are ongoing. Subjective evaluation does not mean that the results of properly conducted comparisons will be unreliable or inaccurate. To the contrary, scientific testing has shown that professional document examiners (as a group) out-perform lay-people when comparing handwriting or signatures to assess authorship. However, this type of 'subjective 'analysis depends greatly upon the competency of an individual examiner. It follows that an examiner should follow appropriate case examination protocols carefully and evaluate all possible propositions, an examiner should be properly trained and their training should include adequate testing of their abilities, the formal case examination procedure should incorporate some form of secondary review (ideally, independent in nature) and every examiner should make every effort to demonstrate and maintain their competency through professional certification and ongoing proficiency testing. Handwriting examinations (edit) The examination of handwriting to assess potential authorship proceeds from the above principle of identification by applying it to a comparison of samples of handwritten material. Generally, there are three stages in the process of examination. In brief, they are: Analysis: The questioned and the known items are analyzed and broken down to directly perceptible characteristics. Comparison: The characteristics of the questioned item are then compared against the known standard. Evaluation: Similarities and differences in the compared properties are evaluated and this determines which ones are valuable for a conclusion. This depends on the uniqueness and frequency of occurrence in the items. Optionally, the procedure may involve a fourth step consisting of verification/ validation or peer review. ASTM has published a standard guide for the examination of handwriting titled ``E2290-07a: Examination of Handwritten Items''. Some of the guides listed under ``Other Examinations'' apply to forensic handwriting comparisons (e.g., E444 or E1658). An alternative guide for the examination of handwriting and signatures has been developed by the Forensic Expertise Profiling Laboratory (School of Human Biosciences, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia). Other examinations (edit) Aside from E2290 mentioned above, many standard guides pertaining to the examination of questioned documents have been published by ASTM International. They include the following: E444-06 Scope of Work Relating to Forensic Document Examiners E2195-02 Terminology: Examination of Questioned Documents E1658-08 Terminology: Expressing Conclusions of Forensic Document Examiners E1422-05 Test Methods for Forensic Writing Ink Comparison E1789-04 Writing Ink Identification E2285-03 Examination of Mechanical Checkwriter Impressions E2286-03 Examination of Dry Seal Impressions E2287-03 Examination of Fracture Patterns and Paper Fibre Impressions on Single-Strike Film Ribbons and Typed Text E2288-03 Physical Match of Paper Cuts, Tears, and Perforations in Forensic Document Examinations E2289-08 Examination of Rubber Stamp Impressions E2291-03 Indentation Examinations E2325-05Non-destructive Examination of Paper E2331-04 Examination of Altered Documents E2388-05 Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners E2389-05 Examination of Documents Produced with Liquid Ink Jet Technology E2390-06 Examination of Documents Produced with Toner Technology E2494-08 Standard Guide for Examination of Typewritten Items Not all laboratories or examiners use or follow ASTM guidelines. These are guidelines and not requirements. There are other ASTM guides of a more general nature that apply (e.g., E 1732: Terminology Relating to Forensic Science).

Most provide certification to individuals from a particular country or geographic area. In some places, the term accreditation may be used instead of certification. Either way, in the present context, it refers to the assessment of an examiner's competency and qualifications by an independent (third-party) organization of professionals. International (border-less) certifying bodies (edit) Forensic Science Society (UK) (edit) The Forensic Science Society (UK) provides their members with the opportunity to obtain a Professional Postgraduate Diploma in forensic disciplines, including Questioned Document Examination. The program is accredited by the University of Strathclyde. Successful applicants are entitled to use the postnominal 'FSSocDip '. Since membership in the FSS (UK) is open to anyone regardless of where they live or work, this is effectively an international certification.

It was ``the most serious of all Tudor rebellions''.

The Lincolnshire Rising was a brief rising by Roman Catholics against the establishment of the Church of England by Henry VIII and the dissolution of the monasteries set in motion by Thomas Cromwell. Both planned to assert the nation's religious autonomy and the king's supremacy over religious matters. The dissolution of the monasteries resulted in much property being transferred to the Crown. The rising began on 2 October 1536 at St James 'Church, Louth, after evensong, shortly after the closure of Louth Park Abbey. The stated aim of the uprising was to protest the suppression of Catholic religious houses, not the rule of Henry VIII himself. It quickly gained support in Horncastle, Market Rasen, Caistor and other nearby towns. Angered by the actions of commissioners, the protesters or rioters demanded the end of the collection of a subsidy, the end of the Ten Articles, an end to the dissolution, an end to taxes in peacetime, a purge of heretics in government and the repeal of the Statute of Uses. With support from local gentry, a force of demonstrators, estimated at up to40,000, marched on Lincoln, Lincolnshire, and, by 14 October, occupied Lincoln Cathedral. They demanded the freedom to continue worshipping as Catholics and protection for the treasures of Lincolnshire churches. The protest was led by a monk and a shoemaker and involved22,000 people. The moratorium effectively ended on 4 October 1536, when the King sent word for the occupiers to disperse or face the forces of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, which had already been mobilised. By 14 October, few remained in Lincoln. Following the rising, the vicar of Louth and Captain Cobbler, two of the main leaders, were captured and hanged at Tyburn. Most of the other local ringleaders were also executed during the next twelve days, including William Moreland, or Borrowby, one of the former Louth Park Abbey monks. A lawyer from Willingham was hanged, drawn and quartered for his involvement. The Lincolnshire Rising helped inspire the more widespread Pilgrimage of Grace. Pilgrimage of Grace and the early Tudor crisis (edit) Pilgrimage of Grace The movement broke out on 13 October 1536, immediately following the failure of the Lincolnshire Rising. Only then was the term 'Pilgrimage of Grace 'used. Historians have identified several key themes of the revolt: Economic (edit) The northern gentry had concerns over the new Statute of Uses. The poor harvest of 1535 had also led to high food prices, which likely contributed to discontent. Political (edit) Many people in northern England disliked the way in which Henry VIII had cast off his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Although her successor, Anne Boleyn, had been unpopular as Catherine's replacement, as both a rumoured Protestant and a southerner, her execution in 1536 on trumped-up charges of adultery and treason had done much to undermine the monarchy's prestige and the King's personal reputation. Aristocrats objected to the rise of Thomas Cromwell, who was 'base born '. Religious (edit) The local church was, for many in the north, the centre of community life. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptisms might be taxed. The recently released Ten Articles and the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more reformed, which went against the conservative beliefs of most northerners. Events (edit) Robert Aske was chosen to lead the insurgents; he was a barrister from London, a resident of the Inns of Court, and the youngest son of Sir Robert Aske of Aughton, near Selby. His family was from Aske Hall, Richmondshire, and had long been in Yorkshire. In 1536, Aske led a band of9,000 followers, who entered and occupied York. He arranged for expelled monks and nuns to return to their houses; the King's newly installed tenants were driven out, and Catholic observances were resumed. The rising was so successful that the royalist leaders, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, opened negotiations with the insurgents at Scawsby Leys, near Doncaster, where Aske had assembled between thirty and forty thousand people. Norfolk promised a general pardon and a Parliament to be held at York within a year, as well as a reprieve for the abbeys until the parliament had met. Naively trusting the king's promises, Aske dismissed his followers. Jesse Childs (a biographer of the Earl of Surrey, Norfolk's son) specifically notes that Henry VIII did not authorize Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk to grant remedies for the grievances. Norfolk's enemies had whispered into the King's ear that the Howards could put down a rebellion of peasants if they wanted to, suggesting that Norfolk sympathized with the Pilgrimage. Norfolk, seeing their vast numbers (he and the Earl of Shrewsbury were outnumbered: they had 5000 and 7000 respectively but there were40,000 pilgrims) negotiated and made promises to avoid being massacred. Suppression (edit) In February 1537 there was a new rising (not authorised by Aske) in Cumberland and Westmorland, called Bigod's Rebellion, under Sir Francis Bigod, of Settrington in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Because he knew the promises he made on behalf of the King would not be met, Norfolk reacted quickly to the new uprising after the Pilgrims did not disperse as they had promised. The rebellion failed and King Henry arrested Bigod, Aske and several other rebels, such as Darcy, John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, the Chief Butler of England; Sir Thomas Percy and Sir Robert Constable. All were convicted of treason and executed. During 1537 Bigod was hanged at Tyburn; Lords Darcy and Hussey both beheaded; Thomas Moigne, M.P. for Lincoln was hanged, drawn and quartered; Sir Robert Constable hanged in chains at Hull; and Robert Aske hanged in chains at York. In total 216 were executed: several lords and knights (including Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Stephen Hamerton, Sir William Lumley, Sir John Constable and Sir William Constable), 6 abbots (Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx, William Trafford, Abbot of Sawley, Matthew Mackarel, Abbot of Barlings and Bishop of Chalcedon, William Thirsk, Abbot of Fountains and the Prior of Bridlington), 38 monks, and 16 parish priests. Sir Nicholas Tempest, Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, was hanged at Tyburn, Sir John Bulmer hanged, drawn and quartered and his wife Margaret Stafford burnt at the stake. In late 1538, Sir Edward Neville, Keeper of the Sewer, was beheaded. The loss of the leaders enabled the Duke of Norfolk to quell the rising, and martial law was imposed upon the demonstrating regions. Norfolk executed some 216 activists (such as Lord Darcy, who tried to implicate Norfolk as a sympathizer): churchmen, monks, commoners. The details of the trial and execution of major leaders were recorded by the author of Wriothesley's Chronicle: Also the 16 day of May (1537) there were arraigned at Westminster afore the King's Commissioners, the Lord Chancellor that day being the chief, these persons following: Sir Robert Constable, knight; Sir Thomas Percy, knight, and brother to the Earl of Northumberland; Sir John Bulmer, knight, and Ralph Bulmer, his son and heir; Sir Francis Bigod, knight; Margaret Cheney, after Lady Bulmer by untrue matrimony; George Lumley, esquire; Robert Aske, gentleman, that was captain in the insurrection of the Northern men; and one Hamerton, esquire, all which persons were indicted of high treason against the King, and that day condemned by a jury of knights and esquires for the same, whereupon they had sentence to be drawn, hanged and quartered, but Ralph Bulmer, the son of John Bulmer, was reprieved and had no sentence. And on the 25 day of May, being the Friday in Whitsun week, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamerton, knights, were hanged and headed; Nicholas Tempest, esquire; Doctor Cockerell, priest; Abbot quondam of Fountains; and Doctor Pickering, friar, were drawn from the Tower of London to Tyburn, and there hanged, bowelled and quartered, and their heads set on London Bridge and divers gates in London. And the same day Margaret Cheney, 'other wife to Bulmer called ', was drawn after them from the Tower of London into Smithfield, and there burned according to her judgment, God pardon her soul, being the Friday in Whitsun week; she was a very fair creature, and a beautiful. Failures (edit) The Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace have traditionally been seen as complete failures for the following reasons: England was not reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church, except during the brief reign of Mary I (1553--1558). The dissolution of the monasteries continued unabated, with the largest monasteries being dissolved by 1540. Great tracts of land were seized from the Church and divided among the Crown and its supporters. The steps towards official Protestantism achieved by Cromwell continued except during the reign of Mary I. Successes (edit) Their partial successes are less known: The government postponed the collection of the October subsidy, a major grievance amongst the Lincolnshire organisations. The Statute of Uses was partially negated by a new law, the Statute of Wills. Four of the seven sacraments that were omitted from the Ten Articles were restored in the Bishop's Book of 1537, which marked the end of the drift of official doctrine towards Protestantism. The Bishop's Book was followed by the Six Articles of 1539. An onslaught upon heresy was promised in a royal proclamation in 1538. Leadership (edit) Historians have noted the leaders among the nobility and gentry in the Lincolnshire Rising and the Pilgrimage of Grace and tend to argue that the Risings gained legitimacy only through the involvement of the northern nobility and gentlemen, such as Lord Darcy, Lord Hussey and Robert Aske. However, historians such as M.E. James, C.S.L. Davies and Andy Wood, among others, believe the question of leadership was more complex. James and Davies look at the Risings of 1536 as the product of common grievances. The lower classes were aggrieved because of the closure of local monasteries by the Act of Suppression. The northern nobility felt their rights were being taken away from them in the Acts of 1535-1536, which made them lose confidence in the royal government. James analysed how the lower classes and the nobility used each other as a legitimizing force in an extremely ordered society. The nobles hid behind the force of the lower classes with claims of coercion, since they were seen as blameless for their actions because they did not possess political choice. This allowed the nobles an arena to air their grievances while, at the same time, playing the victims of popular violence. The lower classes used the nobility to give their grievance a sense of obedience since the ``leaders'' of the rebellion were of a higher social class. Davies considers the leadership of the 1536 Risings as more of a cohesion. Common grievances over evil advisors and religion brought the higher and lower classes together in their fight. Once the nobles had to confront the King's forces and an all-out war, they decided to surrender, thereby ending the cohesion. Historian Andy Wood, representing social historians of the late 20th century who have found more agency among the lower classes, argues that the commons were the effective force behind the Risings. He argues that this force came from a class group largely left out of history: minor gentlemen and well-off farmers. He believes these groups were the leaders of the Risings because they had more political agency and thought.

Towards the end of senior year, Dan got his girlfriend Karen Roe pregnant, but abandoned her to take a basketball scholarship to North Carolina. At college he met Deb Lee, who also became pregnant by him. Dan returned to Tree Hill on the night his and Karen's son Lucas was born but, on seeing Keith with Karen at the hospital, Dan left without Karen seeing him. Dan and Deb married and moved back to Tree Hill with their son Nathan. Dan tried to get joint custody of Lucas, but Karen refused and Dan gave up on trying to be part of Lucas's life. He later became a successful car salesman having set up his own business with Deb's money. Dan is a man with big dreams and expectations, especially regarding his son Nathan, but he doesn't handle it very well when they're not fulfilled. Season 1 (edit) Dan is a controlling father to Nathan, who is now the Ravens 'star player, but has nothing to do with Lucas. When Lucas joins the Ravens, Dan encourages Nathan to give his half-brother a hard time. Dan puts so much pressure on Nathan that Nathan takes drugs to enhance his basketball performance, leading to him collapsing on the court. When Deb finds out, she asks Dan for a divorce. When Dan's parents come to town for Dan's birthday, it is revealed that Dan's father Royal put similar pressure on Dan and that Dan faked the extent of an injury he suffered in college in order to give up basketball. Dan also has an uneasy relationship with Keith, due to Keith's continuing friendship with Karen. When Keith crashes the car he is driving with Lucas inside, Dan pulls Lucas from the car and saves his life, leading to a temporary truce with Karen. Keith is left in financial difficulty due to Lucas's medical bills and Dan offers to buy Keith's garage from him while Keith continues to run it. However, it soon becomes clear that Dan will be running the garage in his own way and Keith quits. After being rejected by Karen, Keith turns to Deb for comfort and they have a one-night stand. On walking in on them in bed together, Dan tells Keith that he is no longer his brother. Dan is about to sign his divorce papers to Deb when he suffers a heart attack. When Deb finds Dan on the floor, Dan tells her ``you'd better hope I die.'' Season 2 (edit) After his heart attack, Dan claims to be a changed person and tries to get closer to Lucas. Dan and Deb are united in their disapproval of Nathan's marriage to Haley. Dan claims to have forgiven Deb and Keith for their fling and a guilty Deb allows Dan to live with her while he recovers. It becomes clear that the new Dan is an act when he lies to Deb after being given a clean bill of health and it is revealed that Keith's new girlfriend Jules was actually hired by Dan to seduce his brother. On discovering that he has the same heart condition as Dan, Lucas agrees to move in with Dan on the conditions that Dan pays for Lucas's medication and keeps this from Karen, and also that Dan leaves Keith and ``Jules'' alone. Dan keeps his promises but Karen discovers the truth about Jules and threatens to tell Keith, leading to Jules leaving Keith at the altar. Dan is delighted at this result and, after knocking down the groom on the wedding cake, looks at Deb saying ``one down, one to go''. On discovering what Dan did, Keith confronts Dan at the dealership and attacks him. Before leaving town, Keith tells Dan that he has nothing left to lose, but Dan does. When Nathan and Haley's marriage is in trouble, Dan is quick to pounce, and gets Nathan to sign annulment papers and move back in with him and Deb. However, Deb wants Dan out of their lives for good, especially after learning that Dan told Nathan that it is his fault that Deb is now addicted to pills. Lucas continues to live with Dan in order to bring down his father once and for all. He finds cash and an incriminating ledger in the attic of the dealership and discovers that Dan has been making money illegally by changing the amounts on bills and pocketing the extra cash. However, Dan has made Deb theco-owner of the dealership, meaning that she would be incriminated too. Dan then reveals he left the cash and ledger for Lucas to find as a test of Lucas's loyalty, which Lucas failed, and so Dan severs all ties to Lucas, even cutting off his son's heart medication. Dan also sabotages Karen's relationship with her business lecturer Andy by walking into one of Andy's classes and telling everyone that Andy is sleeping with Karen, which leads to Andy losing his job. Dan then tries to have Andy deported back to New Zealand. When Karen angrily confronts Dan at the dealership, Dan grabs her and forcefully kisses her, saying ``isn't that was this is really about?'' At the end of the season Dan falls unconscious after drinking a poisoned bottle of whisky that was left for him with a note saying ``for everything you've done''. The dealership is then set on fire with Dan inside. Season 3 (edit) Dan survives the fire, but the dealership is destroyed. Dan at first thinks it was Lucas who tried to kill him when he remembers seeing him in the fire, but it is revealed that Lucas saved him. Wanting access to the fire investigation, Dan runs for mayor of Tree Hill. His family-based campaign includes having Deb pretend to love him in exchange for a final divorce. This ploy works and Dan is elected mayor. As mayor, Dan gains access to CCTV showing Keith buying the whisky used to drug Dan, and when Keith returns to town Dan has him arrested on suspicion of his attempted murder. Although the police release Keith due to lack of evidence, Dan still believes that Keith was the perpetrator, and things become worse when Keith announces that he is going to marry Karen and adopt Lucas. One day at Tree Hill High, Jimmy Edwards takes a gun to school and fires it, causing a lock down. Keith persuades Dan as mayor to let him go into the school to talk to Jimmy, but Jimmy commits suicide by shooting himself in front of Keith. Dan then gets into the school, picks up the gun and shoots Keith, killing him. Jimmy gets the blame for Keith's death as it is assumed that he shot Keith before turning the gun on himself. Dan convinces himself that Keith deserved what he got as he started the war with Dan. Nevertheless, Dan becomes haunted, seeing visions of Keith as a child everywhere, and this has a profound effect on him. Realizing he has to change his ways he tries to get closer to Nathan, telling his son that he is proud of him and that he loves him. Haley then gives Dan a second chance by inviting him to her and Nathan's second wedding. At the ceremony Deb tells Dan that it was her, not Keith, who tried to kill him in the fire. Dan goes to Keith's grave and breaks down. Dan then apologizes to Karen for how he treated her and Lucas and she reveals that she is pregnant with Keith's child. Dan takes her in his arms promising to be there for her this time. He then goes home and discovers that someone has written ``MURDERER'' on his wall. Season 4 (edit) Dan tries to make amends for Keith's death by looking after Karen. However, he still sees messages everywhere calling him a murderer, and wonders if it is all in his head. Meanwhile, Nathan is in deep debt and asks Dan to help him. Dan refuses and Nathan goes to a loan shark, Daunte, instead. Daunte forces Nathan to shave points in a basketball game and then demands that Nathan lose the State Championship. On discovering the trouble that Nathan is in, Dan confronts Daunte and offers to pay him off, but Daunte gets Dan to back down by threatening Nathan, Lucas, the pregnant Haley and Karen. When the Ravens win the State Championship, Daunte runs Haley over and crashes into a construction site. Nathan pulls Daunte out of the car and beats him, before realizing he is dead. Dan takes the fall for Nathan and is arrested. Dan plans to plead guilty to Daunte's murder in order to be punished for Keith's death, but the coroner's report shows that Daunte was already dead when Nathan pulled him out of the car. Dan is released and the experience brings him and Karen closer together, as Karen admires what Dan was willing to do for his son. Dan and Karen begin to come together romantically, attending the school prom together as chaperones, but Dan continues to receive text messages and notes accusing him of killing his brother. Dan discovers that the person sending the messages is Abby Brown, a student who witnessed the shooting. Dan then visits Abby and her mother and tries to explain why he killed Keith, saying ``Karen was mine, she was supposed to be mine''. Abby leaves Tree Hill for good, but not before telling Lucas what she knows. Lucas walks in on Dan and his mother kissing and attacks Dan, shouting that he killed Keith, but Karen refuses to believe him. Lucas then goes to the police, but Dan has got there first and told them that Lucas is just trying to sabotage Dan's relationship with Karen. On learning from Haley that Deb has a gun, Lucas steals the gun and confronts Dan in front of Karen, causing her to collapse. Lucas fires a warning shot to make Dan leave, before rushing the unconscious Karen to hospital. After learning from Deb that Dan killed Keith, Nathan confronts Dan and tells him that he will never be a part of his grandson's life. After Karen's daughter is born by c-section, Dan visits his new niece in the hospital, before turning himself in to the police. Two weeks later, a recovered Karen visits Dan in his cell and tells him that she has a daughter, Lily, who will never know her father because of Dan, before spitting at him. Dan is so distraught by this encounter that he tries to hang himself in his cell with his bedsheet. The sheet unravels after a few seconds, and Dan falls to the floor, left to agonize over what he has done. Season 5 (edit) Four and a half years later, Nathan visits Dan in prison, and tells him that he will never be like him. Nathan then tells Dan that Jamie found a picture of him once and Nathan told him that his grandfather was dead. Later, a prison guard tells Dan that Nathan left behind an envelope, which contains a picture of Jamie. A parole hearing is held for Dan and despite Lucas pleading with the board not to be fooled by Dan, he is released. Soon after, Dan goes to a store to buy a basketball for his grandson and ends up sleeping with the cashier later that night. At Lucas's wedding, Dan sits outside in his car and is confronted by Haley, who tells him to stay away from the family. When Jamie is abducted during the ceremony by his evil nanny, Carrie, Dan saves him and threatens Carrie, telling her that he killed his brother and would have no problem doing the same to her. Dan then returns Jamie to Nathan and Haley's house and is attacked by Lucas and Nathan. On Jamie's 5th birthday Dan goes to drop off a gift and has a confrontation with Deb. After the party Nathan goes and tells Dan to stay away and Dan reveals he only has six months to live due to his HCM. However, after the man in front of him on the heart transplant list dies, he becomes number one. Excited, he leaves the hospital and helps an old man retrieve his cane before suddenly getting hit by a car. Ironically, seconds later his beeper goes off because a heart has been found for him. Season 6 (edit) When he wakes up from the accident, it is revealed that Carrie, Jamie's former nanny, was the one who ran him over, as revenge for interfering with her taking Jamie as her son. He finds himself in a ``hospital room'' but when he tries to escape (Carrie is torturing him) he discovers that he is not in a hospital room, but in her house, in a room which Carrie designed to confuse him by disguising it as a hospital room by putting medical equipment and painting the room, as well as adding hospital-style curtains. Carrie devises a plan to get Jamie by telling Haley that Dan is dying, so that she'll bring Jamie to see him. Carrie goes after Jamie, then Haley too. Dan shoots Carrie once she attempts to kill Haley and Deb. Carrie wakes up later that night, and reminds Dan that he promised he'd kill her if she came near his family again, prompting him to keep his word and shoot her again, this time killing her. As a result, Nathan and Haley let Dan see Jamie, but Nathan quickly reminds his father that he still hates him for killing his uncle. Unfortunately, Dan still finds himself without a heart transplant and has to wait longer. In the mean time, he tries to be a father to Nathan by advising him on his basketball and has a talk with Lucas about the day of the school shooting to help with the Ravens movie. His relationship with Jamie also grows and he finally has a blowout with Deb about Keith. When his heart transplant does come, the man who delivers it trips over a dog's leash and the dog eats it. Dan ultimately loses all hope and attempts to drown himself at a beach. He then goes to tells Jamie goodbye. Jamie becomes upset and asks him who killed Keith; and Dan admits that he did it. Dan leaves Tree Hill, but not before saying some last words to Lucas and Nathan. At the end of the season we see Dan as a broken man. He hates his life and wants to die. To make amends he goes to visit Coach Durham to whom he confesses that when he looks back on his life it all went wrong when he refused to play at the state championship. He tells Coach Durham that he should be dead but he isn't and that he realizes ``this is my hell''. He has to see his family experience the happiest moments of their lives but he can't feel them. To this Coach Durham replies ``you created that, Danny''. Dan then turns a gun on himself but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. He then forces the gun into Coach Durham's hand and begs the latter to shoot him. Later, after Dan cries in his arms, Durham adds, ``there is still time for redemption, son''. Nathan shows up and tells Dan that he has made it to the NBA. Later Peyton lets Dan hold his other grandchild, Sawyer Scott. At the end of the episode he tells the audience that when he looks in the mirror he sees that he was supposed to be someone else, but fell short of that person. Season 7 (edit) Fourteen months have passed since the season six finale, and Dan is now a motivational speaker. He has his own TV show called Scott Free Redemption. He has also written a book with the same title. It is then revealed that he is married to Rachel Gatina. Dan reached out to his son Nathan when he read about him and Renee Richardson, who he meets, asking her to speak on his show. Dan reveals that Renee Richardson was lying about Nathan's alleged affair and exposes her on his show. It is also revealed that Dan did in fact have a heart transplant as he quotes Renee Richardson's con as ``Takes a Con to Know a Con.'' About a year earlier, Dan traveled to Mexico to have a heart transplant. His new wife Rachel Gatina paid with his money for a family to pull the life support plug on their young son. The heart was then given to Dan. Dan returns to Tree Hill and tries to ask forgiveness from Nathan. Nathan will not forgive Dan, but only ``tolerate'' him for Jamie's sake. Dan then meets Clay, who he shakes up (by throwing him in the ocean), telling him not to give up on being an agent. On the eve of Nathan and Haley's departure, Rachel gets Dan to do a live broadcast from the school hallway where he killed Keith. Dan then runs into Jimmy's mother, who tells him she will never be able to forgive him. So instead of reading his script, Dan talks about his life and tells his audience that there is no forgiveness for him, only what comes next. He gives everything that he has to charity as well as divorce papers to Rachel. As he is preparing to leave Tree Hill, Nathan meets up with him to tell him that he's back with the Bobcats, and says thank you. He then says goodbye to Jamie. Season 8 (edit) Dan has moved to a diner, and reappears again when Quinn visits him to help her to kill Katie Ryan, and he convinces her not to do it. In the finale, Nathan visits him and gives him a photo of Lydia and a baseball from Jamie's first game and Dan thinks that there is a chance for forgiveness. Season 9 (edit) Dan burns down his diner and returns to Tree Hill and asks Haley for a place to stay, initially resistant, she offers him money, but he says that he doesn't want money. He moves into Nathan and Haley's house, to the delight of Jamie, who is excited to spend time with him. Nathan tells him that he is going to Europe and that when he comes back he wants him to be gone. When Nathan does not return from Europe, Haley and Jamie blame Dan. He rents out the sound stage from Julian and uses it to find Nathan. Dan, Julian, and Chris Keller save Nathan. However, Dan is shot while rescuing Nathan and dies in the hospital surrounded by Nathan, Haley, Deb, Jamie and Lydia. When he dies, he sees a vision of his brother Keith, who brings him to the hallway where Dan shot Keith and he tells him that he forgives him. When Keith goes into the light, Dan asks him ``I know where you're going, but what about me?'' and Keith says ``Don't worry little brother, You're my plus one.''

A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defines serial killing as ``a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone''.

Meanwhile, Mayor R. Brown (Daly) realizes that Franklin City is facing bankruptcy due to profligate spending on his part. Brown plots with his Chief of Staff (Corddry) to raise money for the town budget (and his upcoming governatorial campaign) by shutting down Jellystone Park and opening the land to logging. To save the park, Smith and his love interest Rachel hold a Centennial Festival and fireworks show in an attempt to sell season passes. To sabotage the effort, Brown promises Jones the position of head ranger if the funds are not raised. Yogi and Boo Boo had promised Smith to stay out of sight during the festival, but Jones convinces them otherwise. The bears try to please the crowd with a waterskiing performance, but Yogi inadvertently sets his cape on fire, causing fireworks to be launched into the crowd, who flee in panic. After Jellystone is shut down, Smith is forced to stay in Evergreen Park, a small urban enclave choked with litter and pollution. Seeing that their home is in danger of being destroyed, Yogi and Boo Boo travel to Evergreen Park, where they and Smith figure out Brown's plan. They all return to Jellystone with Rachel, where they learn that Boo Boo's pet turtle is a rare and endangered species known as a ``Frog-Mouthed'' turtle. The Chief of Staff learns about the turtle and, since the park can not be destroyed if the turtle is living there because it would be home to an endangered species, sends Jones to kidnap it. On the day that Brown is planning a press conference to begin the destruction of the park, Smith, Rachel, and the bears rescue the turtle and try to bring it to the media's attention. Jones, learning that he had been deceived by Mayor Brown, has a change of heart and helps the team bring the turtle to the press conference. At the press conference, Rachel reveals that she had installed a hidden camera in Boo Boo's bow tie which had captured Brown admitting to his plan. Smith hooks up the camera to the big screen Brown is using for his press conference and shows the video. When the turtle is revealed to the citizens as an endangered species, the police arrest Brown. Jellystone Park is reopened and becomes a great success. Smith is reappointed head ranger and he and Rachel admit their feelings for each other. As they kiss, they discover Yogi and Boo Boo are back to stealing picnic baskets once again. Cast (edit) Live-action Cast (edit) Tom Cavanagh as Ranger Smith, the head ranger of Jellystone Park. Anna Faris as Rachel Johnson, a nature documentary filmmaker, and Ranger Smith's love interest. She is called ``Miss Movie Lady'' or ``Miss Moviemaker Lady'' by Yogi and Boo Boo. She has spent time with the animals that she makes a documentary on learning a gorilla's rage and pinning down people like a snow leopard. T.J. Miller as Ranger Jones, a park ranger who is tricked by Mayor Brown into getting Jellystone shut down, making the excuse that Jones will be the head ranger of the park. Andrew Daly as Mayor R. Brown, the main antagonist of the film. He is the Mayor of Franklin City who wants to shut Jellystone Park down so that he can make money for his city and become governor. Nate Corddry as the Chief of Staff, Mayor Brown's assistant. Voice Cast (edit) Dan Aykroyd as the voice of Yogi Bear, the picnic basket-stealing talking brown bear who lives in Jellystone Park. Justin Timberlake as the voice of Boo-Boo Bear, Yogi's sidekick, and sometimes the voice of reason. Josh Robert Thompson as the narrator. Production (edit) On October 2, 2008, it was confirmed that a live-action/ CGI Yogi Bear movie was in the works. Ash Brannon was originally scheduled to direct the film but was replaced by Eric Brevig (Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D) when it was decided that the film would be produced as a 3-D project. Filming took place on the Lake Whakamaru Reserve, Waikato, New Zealand, as it was winter in the northern hemisphere and to wait for summer would put the production end time to be six months longer than if in southern hemisphere. Like many Hanna-Barbera characters, in the original cartoon, Yogi's personality and mannerisms were based on a popular celebrity of the time. Art Carney's Ed Norton character on The Honeymooners was said to be Yogi's inspiration; his voice mannerisms broadly mimic Carney as Norton. Norton, in turn, received influence from Borscht Belt and comedians of vaudeville. Dan Aykroyd, the voice actor of Yogi Bear, stated that he is trying to evoke the influences that shaped the original Yogi Bear's voice. Aykroyd said, ``It's about hitting certain notes, going back to those old Lower East Side rhythms, the Catskills, Jersey, Upstate New York. It's the Yiddish language, essentially, being spoken in English. It's the 'setup, delivery, punch 'that sitcoms live on today. That's where the origin of American humor is.'' Aykroyd has stated that he grew up watching Yogi Bear on the long, cold, dark afternoons in his native Ottawa: ``As a kid growing up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where the sky turns dark in the winter at about 3: 30, Yogi Bear was my fire, my hearth, when I would come home. I would immediately turn on the TV while I thawed out.'' Justin Timberlake came in with a prepared Boo-Boo voice; when he was learning to sing when he was younger, he imitated various cartoon characters. Eric Brevig said that he intended to make a film that did not want parents who remembered watching Yogi Bear cartoons to feel marginalized and displaced by the contemporary rendition of Yogi Bear. Rhythm and Hues provided CGI character animation for Yogi Bear, Boo-Boo Bear and the Frog-Mouthed Turtle in the film. The company had previously worked with Hanna-Barbera on past theatrical productions: The Flintstones (1994), its prequel Viva Rock Vegas (2000), Scooby-Doo (2002), and its sequel Monsters Unleashed (2004). Release (edit) The film was originally slated for release on June 25, 2010, but was pushed back to December 17, 2010, to avoid competition with Grown Ups. Marketing (edit) The film's first trailer was released online on July 28, 2010. It was also attached with Cats& Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore and Alpha and Omega. A second trailer premiered with Legend of the Guardians: The Owls ofGa'Hoole, and a third trailer premiered with Megamind, Tangled, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows--Part 1. One of the trailers was also attached with showings of Tron: Legacy in the United Kingdom. Home media (edit) Warner Home Video released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on March 22, 2011 in four versions: DVD (single disc edition) Blu-ray (single disc edition) Blu-ray+ DVD+ Digital Copy combo pack Blu-ray 3D+ Blu-ray+ DVD+ Digital Copy combo pack Reception (edit) Critical response (edit) On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 101 reviews with an average rating of 3.6/ 10. The site's critical consensus reads, ``Yogi Bear's 3D effects and all-star voice cast are cold comfort for its aggressively mediocre screenplay.'' On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating ``generally unfavorable reviews''. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ``B'' on anA+ to F scale. Common Sense Media gave the film one star, saying ``Dumber-than-average family comedy won't even impress kids.'' IGN gave the film 4.0/ 10, and summed up their review by saying ``Of course, Yogi Bear is meant as a kids movie. And one supposes that it works on that level (the little ones at the press screening I attended seemed mildly amused). But we learned long ago that kids movies can operate on more than one level, and that's not something that director Eric Brevig (Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D) or his screenwriters are interested in. The result is a movie that's dumber than the average bear. Though at least it has a pee joke in it.'' One of the few positive reviews came from film critics at Spill.com, who appreciated the film staying true to its original source material, and not trying to ``hip it up'', comparing the film Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007). The critics also praised Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake's performances, along with the 3D and visual effects. Box office (edit) Yogi Bear debuted at the America and Canadian box office at# 2, behind Tron: Legacy, with an under-performing$16,411,322 compared to Tron Legacy's$44,026,211. The opening weekend was lower than Warner Bros. expected, but executives believed that the film would hold well throughout the holiday season. The film earned$28 million in its first seven days, becoming Warner Bros. 'top grossing start for a family film for that year. In its second weekend, the film fell 53% to$7.8 million, falling to fifth place. This number was a much harder fall than Warner Bros. had hoped for, but it blamed the drop on Christmas Eve landing on a Friday and a big snowstorm in the eastern United States during that period. On Monday, that blame seemed justified, as the film jumped up 11% from Sunday to$3.6 million, which was altogether a 33% jump from its previous Monday. In its third weekend, the film jumped up 66% to$13 million and ranking fourth. The next weekend, it dropped 46% and ranked eighth with$6.8 million. Over the Martin Luther King, Jr. Weekend, it was able to pick up$7.4 million for the four day, jumping up 12% from the previous weekend. The film has picked up$100,246,011 in the United States and Canada and also has a worldwide total of$201,584,141. Against an$80 million budget, the film has become a surprise box office hit.

It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and as of 2009 also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database. The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, oversee the privately owned U.S. member banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region, which entitles them to elect some of their board members. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy; it consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time: the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms. There are also various advisory councils. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components. The structure is considered unique among central banks. It is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used. Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself ``an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.'' The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. The federal government receives all the system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member banks 'capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of$100.2 billion and transferred$97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.

Other purposes are stated in the Federal Reserve Act, such as ``to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes''. Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Today the Federal Reserve System has responsibilities in addition to ensuring the stability of the financial system. Current functions of the Federal Reserve System include: To address the problem of banking panics To serve as the central bank for the United States To strike a balance between private interests of banks and the centralized responsibility of government To supervise and regulate banking institutions To protect the credit rights of consumers To manage the nation's money supply through monetary policy to achieve the sometimes-conflicting goals of maximum employment stable prices, including prevention of either inflation or deflation moderate long-term interest rates To maintain the stability of the financial system and contain systemic risk in financial markets To provide financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions, including playing a major role in operating the nation's payments system To facilitate the exchange of payments among regions To respond to local liquidity needs To strengthen U.S. standing in the world economy Addressing the problem of Bank panics (edit) Further information: Bank run and Fractional-reserve banking Banking institutions in the United States are required to holdreserves\u200d--\u200camounts of currency and deposits in otherbanks\u200d--\u200cequal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929. Check clearing System (edit) Because some banks refused to clear checks from certain others during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in The Federal ReserveSystem\u200d--\u200cPurposes and Functions as follows: By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elasticcurrency\u200d--\u200cthat is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditionswarranted\u200d--\u200cbut also an efficient and equitable check-collection system. Lender of last resort (edit) In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the lender of last resort to those institutions that can not obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector ``clearing houses'' which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs. Fluctuations (edit) Through its discount window and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate). By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates. For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an$85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant American International Group (AIG). Central Bank (edit) Further information: Central bank Obverse of a Federal Reserve$1 note issued in 2009 In its role as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note. Federal funds (edit) Main article: Federal funds Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called Federal Reserve Deposits) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds. Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into federal reserve notes. Private banks maintain their bank reserves in federal reserve accounts. Bank regulation (edit) The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Board of Governors, summarized the history of this compromise: Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees. The legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today. The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the Board of Governors are selected by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Government regulation and supervision (edit) Ben Bernanke (lower-right), Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on February 10, 2009. Members of the Board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one. The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714 (b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government ornon-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board of Governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access (GAO/ T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher. The Board of Governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve: The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, bank holding companies (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and Edge Act and ``agreement corporations'' (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises national banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation supervises state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Some regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, state banks that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing consumer credit protection, such as the Truth in Lending, Equal Credit Opportunity, and Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks. Members of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before congressional committees on the economy, monetary policy, banking supervision and regulation, consumer credit protection, financial markets, and other matters. The Board has regular contact with members of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the President of the United States and has regular meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well. Regulatory and oversight responsibilities (edit) The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the Board of Governors. This policy is described in United States Code: Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time. National payments System (edit) The Federal Reserve plays an important role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities. In the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services. The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retailclients\u200d--\u200cindividuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks 'retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks 'wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the Fedwire Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service. Structure (edit) Main article: Structure of the Federal Reserve System Organization of the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System has a ``unique structure that is both public and private'' and is described as ``independent within the government'' rather than ``independent of government''. The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the Federal Reserve Act, which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal. The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are (1) the Board of Governors, (2) the Federal Open Market Committee, (3) the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and (4) the member banks throughout the country.

Williams Board of Governors (edit) Main article: Federal Reserve Board of Governors The seven-member Board of Governors is a federal agency. It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It also supervises and regulates the U.S. banking system in general. Governors are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms. One term begins every two years, on February 1 of even-numbered years, and members serving a full term can not be renominated for a second term. ``(U) pon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified.'' The law provides for the removal of a member of the board by the President ``for cause''. The board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President from among the sitting Governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the President chooses, until their terms on the Board of Governors expire. List of members of the Board of Governors (edit) The current members of the Board of Governors are as follows: Governor Political Party Entered office Term expires Janet Yellen (Chair) Democratic February 3, 2014 (as Chair) October 4, 2010 (as Governor) February 3, 2018 (as Chair) January 31, 2024 (as Governor) Vacant (Vice Chair) N/ A (as Vice Chair) January 31, 2020 (as Governor) Randal Quarles (Vice Chair for Supervision) Republican October 13, 2017 (as Vice Chair for Supervision) October 13, 2017 October 13, 2021 (as Vice Chair for Supervision) January 31, 2018 (as Governor) Jerome Powell Republican May 25, 2012 June 16, 2014 (new term) January 31, 2028 Lael Brainard Democratic June 16, 2014 January 31, 2026 Vacant January 31, 2022 Vacant January 31, 2030* Indicates the date of term expiration for the individual nominated to this vacant position. Nominations, confirmations and resignations (edit) In late December 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Jeremy C. Stein, a Harvard University finance professor and a Democrat, and Jerome Powell, formerly of Dillon Read, Bankers Trust and The Carlyle Group and a Republican. Both candidates also have Treasury Department experience in the Obama and George H.W. Bush administrations respectively. ``Obama administration officials (had) regrouped to identify Fed candidates after Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, withdrew his nomination to the board in June (2011) in the face of Republican opposition. Richard Clarida, a potential nominee who was a Treasury official under George W. Bush, pulled out of consideration in August (2011)'', one account of the December nominations noted. The two other Obama nominees in 2011, Yellen and Raskin, were confirmed in September. One of the vacancies was created in 2011 with the resignation of Kevin Warsh, who took office in 2006 to fill the unexpired term ending January 31, 2018, and resigned his position effective March 31, 2011. In March 2012, U.S. Senator David Vitter (R, LA) said he would oppose Obama's Stein and Powell nominations, dampening near-term hopes for approval. However Senate leaders reached a deal, paving the way for affirmative votes on the two nominees in May 2012 and bringing the board to full strength for the first time since 2006 with Duke's service after term end. Later, on January 6, 2014, the United States Senate confirmed Yellen's nomination to be Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors; she is slated to be the first woman to hold the position and will become Chair on February 1, 2014. Subsequently, President Obama nominated Stanley Fischer to replace Yellen as the Vice Chair. In April 2014, Stein announced he was leaving to return to Harvard May 28 with four years remaining on his term. At the time of the announcement, the FOMC ``already is down three members as it awaits the Senate confirmation of... Fischer and Lael Brainard, and as (President) Obama has yet to name a replacement for... Duke... Powell is still serving as he awaits his confirmation for a second term.'' Allan R. Landon, former president and CEO of the Bank of Hawaii, was nominated in early 2015 by President Obama to the board. In July 2015, President Obama nominated University of Michigan economist Kathryn M. Dominguez to fill the second vacancy on the board. The Senate had not yet acted on Landon's confirmation by the time of the second nomination. Daniel Tarullo submitted his resignation from the board on February 10, 2017, effective on or around April 5, 2017. Federal open market Committee (edit) Main article: Federal Open Market Committee The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the Board of Governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two-and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the Chair of the Board of Governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed. Federal advisory Council (edit) Main article: Federal Advisory Council The Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction. Federal Reserve banks (edit) Main article: Federal Reserve Bank Map of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, with the twelve Federal Reserve Banks marked as black squares, and all Branches within each district (24 total) marked as red circles. The Washington DC Headquarters is marked with a star. (Also, a 25th branch in Buffalo, NY had been closed in 2008.) The twelve Reserve Banks buildings in 1936 There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed. The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and can not be altered by the member banks. Member banks, do however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks 'boards of directors. Each regional Bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their Bank. Each regional Reserve Bank's president is nominated by their Bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the Board of Governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed. Each regional Bank's board consists of nine members. Members are broken down into three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank's shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks 'interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region's member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the Board of Governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public. Legal status of regional Federal Reserve banks (edit) The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary. In Lewis v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: ``The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA (the Federal Tort Claims Act), but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.'' The opinion went on to say, however, that: ``The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes.'' Another relevant decision is Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the Board of Governors, which is a federal agency. Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written that:... the ``ownership'' of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank ``profits.''... Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates. Plaque marking a bank as a member Member banks (edit) A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank), upon meeting certain standards. The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus. However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks can not be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member, a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6% of their purchased stock. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks 'profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of$100.2 billion and distributed$2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning$97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank. Accountability (edit) The GAO and an outside auditor regularly audit the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve banks, and individual member banks. Audits do not cover ``most of the Fed's monetary policy actions or decisions, including discount window lending (direct loans to financial institutions), open-market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee''... (nor may the GAO audit) ``dealings with foreign governments and other central banks.'' As of August 27, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board has been publishing unaudited financial reports for the Federal Reserve banks every quarter. This is an expansion of prior financial reporting practices. Greater transparency is offered with more frequent disclosure and more detail. November 7, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. News brought a lawsuit against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to force the board to reveal the identities of firms for which it has provided guarantees during the financial crisis of 2007--2008. Bloomberg, L.P. won at the trial court and the Fed's appeals were rejected at both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The data was released on March 31, 2011. Monetary policy (edit) Further information: Monetary policy of the United States The term ``monetary policy'' refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States. Interbank lending (edit) The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the federal funds rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of excess reserves. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three ``tools'' of monetary policy described in the Tools section below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005: The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks... By conducting open market operations, imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives. Effects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth. Tools (edit) There are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks: Tool Description Open market operations Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agencysecurities\u200d--\u200cthe Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade. Discount rate The interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lendingfacility\u200d--\u200cthe discount window. Reserve requirements The amount of funds that a depository institution must hold in reserve against specified deposit liabilities. Federal funds rate and open market operations (edit) Further information: Open market operations, money creation, and federal funds rate The Federal Reserve System implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time. Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of United States Treasury security, sometimes called ``Treasury bills'' or more informally ``T-bills'' or ``Treasuries''. The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions. The Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows: Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market 'means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market 'in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does businesswith\u200d--\u200cthe primarydealers\u200d--\u200ccompete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy. Open market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers. The Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos)\u200d--\u200cthe dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date. Repurchase agreements (edit) Further information: Repurchase agreement To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days. Discount rate (edit) Further information: Discount window The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the ``discount rate'', which is the interest rate for ``discount window lending'', overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the ``discount rate'' option. The equivalent operation by the European Central Bank is referred to as the ``marginal lending facility''. Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the prime rate, which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate. Reserve requirements (edit) Another instrument of monetary policy adjustment employed by the Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, also known as the required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve. Reserve Requirements in the U.S. Federal Reserve System Liability Type Requirement Percentage of liabilities Effective date Net transaction accounts$0 to$11.5 million 0 December 29, 2011 More than$11.5 million to$71 million December 29, 2011 More than$71 million 10 December 29, 2011 Nonpersonal time deposits 0 December 27, 1990 Eurocurrency liabilities 0 December 27, 1990 As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions 'required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gives the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC. New facilities (edit) In order to address problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007. It was first announced as a temporary tool but there have been suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time. Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy. The differences between these three new facilities is described by the Federal Reserve: The Term Auction Facility program offers term funding to depository institutions via abi-weekly auction, for fixed amounts of credit. The Term Securities Lending Facility will be an auction for a fixed amount of lending of Treasury general collateral in exchange for OMO-eligible and AAA/ Aaa rated private-label residential mortgage-backed securities. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility now allows eligible primary dealers to borrow at the existing Discount Rate for up to 120 days. Some measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address this mortgage crisis have not been used since the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve gives a brief summary of these new facilities: As the economy has slowed in the last nine months and credit markets have become unstable, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps to help address the situation. These steps have included the use of traditional monetary policy tools at the macroeconomic level as well as measures at the level of specific markets to provide additional liquidity. The Federal Reserve's response has continued to evolve since pressure on credit markets began to surface last summer, but all these measures derive from the Fed's traditional open market operations and discount window tools by extending the term of transactions, the type of collateral, or eligible borrowers. A fourth facility, the Term Deposit Facility, was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. The Term Deposit Facility allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system. Term Auction Facility (edit) Further information: Term auction facility The Term Auction Facility is a program in which the Federal Reserve auctions term funds to depository institutions. The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. The reason it was created is that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the discount window because it is usually associated with the stigma of bank failure. Under the Term Auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds is protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure. Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U.S. dollars. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefly described this facility to the U.S. House of Representatives on January 17, 2008: the Federal Reserve recently unveiled a term auction facility, or TAF, through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit can be auctioned to eligible borrowers. The goal of the TAF is to reduce the incentive for banks to hoard cash and increase their willingness to provide credit to households and firms... TAF auctions will continue as long as necessary to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets, and we will continue to work closely and cooperatively with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives. It is also described in the Term Auction Facility FAQ The TAF is a credit facility that allows a depository institution to place a bid for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate that is determined as the result of an auction. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress. In short, the TAF will auction term funds of approximately one-month maturity. All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All TAF credit must be fully collateralized. Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit. The same collateral values and margins applicable for other Federal Reserve lending programs will also apply for the TAF. Term securities lending Facility (edit) The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28-day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased. Primary dealer credit Facility (edit) The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an overnight loan facility that will provide funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now primary dealers can borrow directly from the Fed when this used to be prohibited. Interest on reserves (edit) Main article: Interest on excess reserves in the United States As of October 2008, the Federal Reserve banks will pay interest on reserve balances (required and excess) held by depository institutions. The rate is set at the lowest federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period of an institution, less 75 bp. As of October 23, 2008, the Fed has lowered the spread to a mere 35 bp. Term deposit Facility (edit) The Term Deposit Facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks will offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. By removing ``excess deposits'' from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that: Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy. The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near-term conduct of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five ``small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures.'' After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis. The Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News: Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than$1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms: Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks 'reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally... As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so. When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so. Asset backed commercial paper money market Mutual Fund liquidity Facility (edit) The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB. Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria: was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19, 2008 from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund; was purchased by Borrower at the Fund's acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower; was rated at the time pledged to FRBB, not lower than A1, F1, or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or, if rated by only one major rating agency, the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency; was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18, 2008; and had stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days fornon-bank Borrowers. Commercial paper funding Facility (edit) On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper using the new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit fornon-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around$1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was$1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from$1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than$2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total$738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF. Quantitative policy (edit) A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative policy. With that the Federal Reserve actually buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business. The bursting of the United States housing bubble prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of$1.25 trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages. History (edit) Timeline of central banking in the United States Dates System 1782--1791 Bank of North America (de facto, under the Confederation Congress) 1791--1811 First Bank of the United States 1811--1816 No central bank 1816--1836 Second Bank of the United States 1837--1862 Free Banking Era 1846--1921 Independent Treasury System 1863--1913 National Banks 1913--present Federal Reserve System Sources: Central banking in the United States, 1791--1913 (edit) Main article: History of central banking in the United States The first attempt at a national currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775 the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills ``Continentals''. The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states 'ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28. In 1791, the government granted the First Bank of the United States a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811. The First Bank of the United States came to an end under President Madison because Congress refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England. Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day. First central Bank, 1791 and second central Bank, 1816 (edit) The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on February 25, 1791, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton. This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, because Congress refused to renew it. In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the Second Bank of the United States. Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the debt. The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, in the Free Banking Era there was no formal central bank. From 1846 to 1921, an Independent Treasury System ruled. From 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act during which series of bank panics, in 1873, 1893, and 1907 occurred Creation of third central Bank, 1907--1913 (edit) Main article: History of the Federal Reserve System The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the Panic of 1907, which caused renewed demands for banking and currency reform. During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the United States economy went through a series of financial panics. According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an inelastic currency and a lack of liquidity. In 1908, Congress enacted the Aldrich--Vreeland Act, which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform. The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress. A revision crafted during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nation's top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the Federal Reserve Act. The House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 yeas to 60 nays, and the Senate voted 43--25 on December 23, 1913. President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill later that day. Federal Reserve Act, 1913 (edit) Main article: Federal Reserve Act Newspaper clipping, December 24, 1913 The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich. Aldrich set up two commissions--one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them. In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. Paul Warburg, an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was ``bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties''. After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the ``Aldrich Plan'', was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible. The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors. Aldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan, but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the ``eastern establishment''. In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply. Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control. The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress. Nonetheless, President Woodrow Wilson believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator Robert Owen in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the Board of Directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government. The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913, on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting ``yea'' and most Republicans voting ``nay''. Federal Reserve Era, 1913-present (edit) Main article: History of the Federal Reserve This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2015) Key laws affecting the Federal Reserve have been: Federal Reserve Act, 1913 Glass--Steagall Act Banking Act of 1935 Employment Act of 1946 Federal Reserve-Treasury Department Accord of 1951 Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the amendments of 1970 Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 International Banking Act of 1978 Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (1978) Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (1980) Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 Gramm--Leach--Bliley Act (1999) Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act (2006) Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (2008) Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) Measurement of economic variables (edit) The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the Board of Governors Economic Data and Research page, the Board of Governors statistical releases and historical data page, and at the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy. Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and Lawrence H. White objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo. Net worth of households and nonprofit organizations (edit) Total NetWorth\u200d--\u200cBalance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949--2012 The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled Flow of Funds. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was$64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was$95.5 trillion. Money supply (edit) Further information: Money supply The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows: Measure Definition M0 The total of all physical currency, plus accounts at the central bank that can be exchanged for physical currency. M1 M0+ those portions of M0 held as reserves or vault cash+ the amount in demand accounts (``checking'' or ``current'' accounts). M2 M1+ most savings accounts, money market accounts, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under$100,000). M3 M2+ all other CDs, deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information. The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail. Personal consumption expenditures price index (edit) Further information: Personal consumption expenditures price index The Personal consumption expenditures price index, also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including United States Consumer Price Index and U.S. Producer Price Index prices, it is derived from the largest component of the gross domestic product in the BEA's National Income and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures. One of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success. Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent. There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific inflation targeting policy. Inflation and the economy (edit) Most mainstream economists favor a low, steady rate of inflation. Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation may reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Unemployment rate (edit) Further information: Unemployment rate\u00a7 United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, and List of U.S. states by unemployment rate United States unemployment rates 1975--2010 showing variance between the fifty states One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation's economic health. Budget (edit) The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast majority (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as ``capital gains/ losses'' that may arise from the buying/ selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans. The Board of Governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses as well as the net profit or loss is the large report simply titled, ``Annual Report''. It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called ``Annual Report: Budget Review''. These detailed comprehensive reports can be found at the Board of Governors 'website under the section ``Reports to Congress'' Net worth (edit) Balance sheet (edit) This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (July 2015) Federal Reserve total assets, treasuries, and mortages One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or balance statement). In accordance with Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the ``Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks'' showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The Board of Governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes. Below is the balance sheet as of July 6, 2011 (in billions of dollars): NOTE: The Fed balance sheet shown in this article has assets, liabilities and net equity that do not add up correctly. The Fed balance sheet is missing the item ``Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks'' which would make the figures balance.

Critique of the organization and system has come from sources such as writers, journalists, economists, and financial institutions as well as politicians and various government employees. Criticisms include transparency, doubt of efficacy due to what is seen by some as poor historical performance and traditionalist concerns about the debasement of the value of the dollar. From the beginning, the Federal Reserve has been the subject of many popular conspiracy theories, that typically link the Fed to numerous other supposed conspiracies.

Before its introduction, banks either had to raise money in the open market or use the so-called ``discount window'' for emergencies.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System established the temporary Term Auction Facility, dubbed TAF, in December to provide cash after interest-rate cuts failed to break banks 'reluctance to lend amid concern about losses related to subprime mortgage securities.

December 13, 2007. Retrieved August 29, 2011. The Fed's discount window, for instance, through which it lends direct to banks, has barely been approached, despite the soaring spreads in the interbank market. The quarter-point cuts in its federal funds rate and discount rate on December 11 were followed by a steep sell-off in the stockmarket... The hope is that by extending the maturity of central-bank money, broadening the range of collateral against which banks can borrow and shifting from direct lending to an auction, the central bankers will bring down spreads in the one-and three-month money markets. There will be no net addition of liquidity. What the central bankers add at longer-term maturities, they will take out in the overnight market. But there are risks. The first is that, for all the fanfare, the central banks 'plan will make little difference. After all, it does nothing to remove the fundamental reason why investors are worried about lending to banks. This is the uncertainty about potential losses from subprime mortgages and the products based on them, and--given that uncertainty--the banks 'own desire to hoard capital against the chance that they will have to strengthen their balance sheets.

For the devolution of property not disposed of by will, see inheritance and intestacy. Though it has at times been thought that a ``will'' was historically limited to real property while ``testament'' applies only to dispositions of personal property (thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as ``Last Will and Testament''), the historical records show that the terms have been used interchangeably. Thus, the word ``will'' validly applies to both personal and real property. A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only after the death of the testator.

According to Plutarch, the written will was invented by Solon. Originally it was a device intended solely for men who died without an heir. The English phrase ``will and testament'' is derived from a period in English law when Old English and Law French were used side by side for maximum clarity. Other such legal doublets include ``breaking and entering'' and ``peace and quiet''. Freedom of disposition (edit) Last will and testament of Tennessee Williams The conception of the freedom of disposition by will, familiar as it is in modern England and the United States, both generally considered common law systems, is by no means universal. In fact, complete freedom is the exception rather than the rule. Civil law systems often put some restrictions on the possibilities of disposal; see for example ``Forced heirship''. Advocates for gays and lesbians have pointed to the inheritance rights of spouses as desirable for same-sex couples as well, through same-sex marriage or civil unions. Opponents of such advocacy rebut this claim by pointing to the ability of same-sex couples to disperse their assets by will. Historically, however, it was observed that ``(e) ven if a same-sex partner executes a will, there is risk that the survivor will face prejudice in court when disgruntled heirs challenge the will'', with courts being more willing to strike down wills leaving property to a same-sex partner on such grounds as incapacity or undue influence. Types of wills (edit) Types of wills generally include: nuncupative (non-culpatory)-oral or dictated; often limited to sailors or military personnel. holographic will-written in the hand of the testator; in many jurisdictions, the signature and the material terms of the holographic will must be in the handwriting of the testator. self-proved-in solemn form with affidavits of subscribing witnesses to avoid probate. notarial-will in public form and prepared by a civil-law notary (civil-law jurisdictions and Louisiana, United States). mystic-sealed until death. serviceman's will-will of person in active-duty military service and usually lacking certain formalities, particularly under English law. reciprocal/ mirror/ mutual/ husband and wife wills-wills made by two or more parties (typically spouses) that make similar or identical provisions in favor of each other. unsolemn will-will in which the executor is unnamed. will in solemn form-signed by testator and witnesses. Some jurisdictions recognize a holographic will, made out entirely in the testator's own hand, or in some modern formulations, with material provisions in the testator's hand. The distinctive feature of a holographic will is less that it is handwritten by the testator and often that it need not be witnessed. In Louisiana this type of testament is called an Olographic or Mystic will. It must be entirely written, dated, and signed in the handwriting of the testator. Although the date may appear anywhere in the testament, the testator must sign the testament at the end of the testament. Any additions or corrections must also be entirely hand written to have effect. In England, the formalities of wills are relaxed for soldiers who express their wishes on active service; any such will is known as a serviceman's will. A minority of jurisdictions even recognize the validity of nuncupative wills (oral wills), particularly for military personnel or merchant sailors. However, there are often constraints on the disposition of property if such an oral will is used. Terminology (edit) Administrator-person appointed or who petitions to administer an estate in an intestate succession. The antiquated English term of administratrix was used to refer to a female administrator but is generally no longer in standard legal usage. Beneficiary-anyone receiving a gift or benefiting from a trust Bequest-testamentary gift of personal property, traditionally other than money. Codicil-(1) amendment to a will; (2) a will that modifies or partially revokes an existing or earlier will. Decedent-the deceased (U.S. term) Demonstrative Legacy-a gift of a specific sum of money with a direction that is to be paid out of a particular fund. Descent-succession to real property. Devise-testamentary gift of real property. Devisee-beneficiary of real property under a will. Distribution-succession to personal property. Executor/ executrix or personal representative (PR)-person named to administer the estate, generally subject to the supervision of the probate court, in accordance with the testator's wishes in the will. In most cases, the testator will nominate an executor/ PR in the will unless that person is unable or unwilling to serve. In some cases a literary executor may be appointed to manage a literary estate. Exordium clause is the first paragraph or sentence in a will and testament, in which the testator identifies himself or herself, states a legal domicile, and revokes any prior wills. Inheritor-a beneficiary in a succession, testate or intestate. Intestate-person who has not created a will, or who does not have a valid will at the time of death. Legacy-testamentary gift of personal property, traditionally of money. Note: historically, a legacy has referred to either a gift of real property or personal property. Legatee-beneficiary of personal property under a will, i.e., a person receiving a legacy. Probate-legal process of settling the estate of a deceased person. Specific legacy (or specific bequest)-a testamentary gift of a precisely identifiable object. Testate-person who dies having created a will before death. Testator-person who executes or signs a will; that is, the person whose will it is. The antiquated English term of Testatrix was used to refer to a female and is still in use in the US. Trustee-a person who has the duty under a will trust to ensure that the rights of the beneficiaries are upheld. Requirements for creation (edit) Muhammad Ali Jinnah's will, excerpt Any person over the age of majority and having ``testamentary capacity'' (i.e., generally, being of sound mind) can make a will, with or without the aid of a lawyer. Additional requirements may vary, depending on the jurisdiction, but generally include the following requirements: The testator must clearly identify themselves as the maker of the will, and that a will is being made; this is commonly called ``publication'' of the will, and is typically satisfied by the words ``last will and testament'' on the face of the document. The testator should declare that he or she revokes all previous wills and codicils. Otherwise, a subsequent will revokes earlier wills and codicils only to the extent to which they are inconsistent. However, if a subsequent will is completely inconsistent with an earlier one, the earlier will is considered completely revoked by implication. The testator may demonstrate that he or she has the capacity to dispose of their property (``sound mind''), and does so freely and willingly. The testator must sign and date the will, usually in the presence of at least two disinterested witnesses (persons who are not beneficiaries). There may be extra witnesses, these are called ``supernumerary'' witnesses, if there is a question as to an interested-party conflict. Some jurisdictions, notably Pennsylvania, have long abolished any requirement for witnesses. In the United States, Louisiana requires both attestation by two witnesses as well as notarization by a notary public. ``Holographic'' or handwritten wills generally require no witnesses to be valid. If witnesses are designated to receive property under the will they are witnesses to, this has the effect, in many jurisdictions, of either (i) disallowing them to receive under the will, or (ii) invalidating their status as a witness. In a growing number of states in the United States, however, an interested party is only an improper witness as to the clauses that benefit him or her (for instance, in Illinois). The testator's signature must be placed at the end of the will. If this is not observed, any text following the signature will be ignored, or the entire will may be invalidated if what comes after the signature is so material that ignoring it would defeat the testator's intentions. One or more beneficiaries (devisees, legatees) must generally be clearly stated in the text, but some jurisdictions allow a valid will that merely revokes a previous will, revokes a disposition in a previous will, or names an executor. There is no legal requirement that a will be drawn up by a lawyer, although there are pitfalls into which home-made wills can fall. The person who makes a will is not available to explain him or herself, or to correct any technical deficiency or error in expression, when it comes into effect on that person's death, and so there is little room for mistake. A common error, for example, in the execution of home-made wills in England is to use a beneficiary (typically a spouse or other close family members) as a witness--which may have the effect in law of disinheriting the witness regardless of the provisions of the will. A will may not include a requirement that an heir commit an illegal, immoral, or other act against public policy as a condition of receipt. In community property jurisdictions, a will can not be used to disinherit a surviving spouse, who is entitled to at least a portion of the testator's estate. In the United States, children may be disinherited by a parent's will, except in Louisiana, where a minimum share is guaranteed to surviving children. Many civil law countries follow a similar rule. In England and Wales from 1933 to 1975, a will could disinherit a spouse but since the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 such an attempt can be defeated by a court order if it leaves the surviving spouse (or other entitled dependent) without reasonable financial provision. International wills (edit) In 1973 an international convention, the Convention providing a Uniform Law on the Form of an International Will, was concluded in the context of UNIDROIT. The Convention provided for a universally recognised code of rules under which a will made anywhere, by any person of any nationality, would be valid and enforceable in every country which became a party to the Convention. These are known as ``international wills''. Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Canada (for 9 provinces, not Quebec), Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Italy, Libya, Niger, Portugal Slovenia, The Holy See, Iran, Laos, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, the United Kingdom, and the United States have signed but not ratified. International wills are only valid where the convention applies. Although the US has not ratified on behalf of any state, the Uniform law has been enacted in 23 States and the District of Columbia. For individuals who own assets in multiple countries and at least one of those countries are not a part of the Convention, it may be appropriate for the person to have multiple wills, one for each country. In some nations, multiple wills may be useful to reduce or avoid taxes upon the estate and its assets. Care must be taken to avoid accidental revocation of prior wills, conflicts between the wills, to anticipate jurisdictional and choice of law issues that may arise during probate. Revocation (edit) Methods and effect (edit) Intentional physical destruction of a will by the testator will revoke it, through deliberately burning or tearing the physical document itself, or by striking out the signature. In most jurisdictions, partial revocation is allowed if only part of the text or a particular provision is crossed out. Other jurisdictions will either ignore the attempt or hold that the entire will was actually revoked. A testator may also be able to revoke by the physical act of another (as would be necessary if he or she is physically incapacitated), if this is done in their presence and in the presence of witnesses. Some jurisdictions may presume that a will has been destroyed if it had been last seen in the possession of the testator but is found mutilated or can not be found after their death. A will may also be revoked by the execution of a new will. Most wills contain stock language that expressly revokes any wills that came before them, however, because normally a court will still attempt to read the wills together to the extent they are consistent. In some jurisdictions, the complete revocation of a will automatically revives the next most recent will, while others hold that revocation leaves the testator with no will so that their heirs will instead inherit by intestate succession. In England and Wales, marriage will automatically revoke a will as it is presumed that upon marriage, a testator will want to review the will. A statement in a will that it is made in contemplation of forthcoming marriage to a named person will override this. Divorce, conversely, will not revoke a will, but in many jurisdictions, will have the effect that the former spouse is treated as if they had died before the testator and so will not benefit. Where a will has been accidentally destroyed, on evidence that this is the case, a copy will or draft will may be admitted to probate. Dependent relative revocation (edit) Many jurisdictions exercise an equitable doctrine known as dependent relative revocation (``DRR''). Under this doctrine, courts may disregard a revocation that was based on a mistake of law on the part of the testator as to the effect of the revocation. For example, if a testator mistakenly believes that an earlier will can be revived by the revocation of a later will, the court will ignore the later revocation if the later will comes closer to fulfilling the testator's intent than not having a will at all. The doctrine also applies when a testator executes a second, or new will and revokes their old will under the (mistaken) belief that the new will would be valid. However, if for some reason the new will is not valid, a court may apply the doctrine to reinstate and probate the old will, if the court holds that the testator would prefer the old will to intestate succession. Before applying the doctrine, courts may require (with rare exceptions) that there have been an alternative plan of disposition of the property. That is, after revoking the prior will, the testator could have made an alternative plan of disposition. Such a plan would show that the testator intended the revocation to result in the property going elsewhere, rather than just being a revoked disposition. Secondly, courts require either that the testator have recited their mistake in the terms of the revoking instrument, or that the mistake be established by clear and convincing evidence. For example, when the testator made the original revocation, he must have erroneously noted that he was revoking the gift ``because the intended recipient has died'' or ``because I will enact a new will tomorrow.'' DRR may be applied to restore a gift erroneously struck from a will if the intent of the testator was to enlarge that gift, but will not apply to restore such a gift if the intent of the testator was to revoke the gift in favor of another person. For example, suppose Tom has a will that bequeaths$5,000 to his secretary, Alice Johnson. If Tom crosses out that clause and writes ``$7,000 to Alice Johnson'' in the margin, but does not sign or date the writing in the margin, most states would find that Tom had revoked the earlier provision, but had not effectively amended his will to add the second; however, under DRR the revocation would be undone because Tom was acting under the mistaken belief that he could increase the gift to$7,000 by writing that in the margin. Therefore, Alice will get5,000 dollars. However, the doctrine of relative revocation will not apply if the interlineation decreases the amount of the gift from the original provision (e.g., ``$5,000 to Alice Johnson'' is crossed out and replaced with ``$3,000 to Alice Johnson'' without Testator's signature or the date in the margin; DRR does not apply and Alice Johnson will take nothing). Similarly, if Tom crosses out that clause and writes in the margin ``$5,000 to Betty Smith'' without signing or dating the writing, the gift to Alice will be effectively revoked. In this case, it will not be restored under the doctrine of DRR because even though Tom was mistaken about the effectiveness of the gift to Betty, that mistake does not affect Tom's intent to revoke the gift to Alice. Because the gift to Betty will be invalid for lack of proper execution, that$5,000 will go to Tom's residuary estate. Election against the will (edit) Also referred to as ``electing to take against the will.'' In the United States, many states have probate statutes which permit the surviving spouse of the decedent to choose to receive a particular share of deceased spouse's estate in lieu of receiving the specified share left to him or her under the deceased spouse's will. As a simple example, under Iowa law (see Code of Iowa Section 633.238 (2005)), the deceased spouse leaves a will which expressly devises the marital home to someone other than the surviving spouse. The surviving spouse may elect, contrary to the intent of the will, to live in the home for the remainder of his/ her lifetime. This is called a ``life estate'' and terminates immediately upon the surviving spouse's death. The historical and social policy purposes of such statutes are to assure that the surviving spouse receives a statutorily set minimum amount of property from the decedent. Historically, these statutes were enacted to prevent the deceased spouse from leaving the survivor destitute, thereby shifting the burden of care to the social welfare system. In New York, a surviving spouse is entitled to one-third of her deceased spouse's estate. The decedent's debts, administrative expenses and reasonable funeral expenses are paid prior to the calculation of the spousal elective share. The elective share is calculated through the ``net estate.'' The net estate is inclusive of property that passed by the laws of intestacy, testamentary property, and testamentary substitutes, as enumerated in EPTL 5-1.1-A. New York's classification of testamentary substitutes that are included in the net estate make it challenging for a deceased spouse to disinherit their surviving spouse. Notable wills (edit) Alfred Nobel's will. In antiquity, Julius Caesar's will naming his grand-nephew Octavian as his adopted son and heir funded and legitimized his rise to political power in the late Republic, providing him the resources necessary to win the civil wars against the ``Liberators'' and Antony and to establish the Roman Empire under the name Augustus. Antony's officiating at the public reading of the will led to a riot and moved public opinion against Caesar's assassins. Octavian's illegal publication of Antony's sealed will was an important factor in removing his support within Rome, as it described his wish to be buried in Alexandria beside the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. In the modern era, the Thellusson v Woodford will case led to British legislation against the accumulation of money for later distribution and was fictionalized as Jarndyce and Jarndyce in Dickens's Bleak House. The Nobel Prizes were established by Alfred Nobel's will. Charles Vance Millar's will provoked the Great Stork Derby, as he successfully bequeathed the bulk of his estate to the Toronto-area woman who had the greatest number of children in the ten years after his death. (The prize was divided among four women who had nine, with smaller payments made to women who had borne 10 children but lost some to miscarriage. Another woman who bore ten children was disqualified as several were illegitimate.) The longest known legal will is that of Englishwoman Frederica Evelyn Stilwell Cook. Probated in 1925, it was1,066 pages, and had to be bound in 4 volumes; her estate was worth$100,000. The shortest known legal wills are those of Bimla Rishi of Delhi, India (``all to son'') and Karl Tausch of Hesse, Germany, (``all to wife'') both containing only two words in the language they were written in (Hindi and Czech respectively) The shortest will is of Shripad Krishnarao Vaidya of Nagpur, Maharashtra consisting 5 letters as, ``HEIR'S''. Probate (edit) Main article: Probate See also: Administration of an estate on death and Probate court After the testator has died, an application for probate may be made in a court with probate jurisdiction to determine the validity of the will or wills that the testator may have created, i.e., which will satisfy the legal requirements, and to appoint an executor. In most cases, during probate, at least one witness is called upon to testify or sign a ``proof of witness'' affidavit. In some jurisdictions, however, statutes may provide requirements for a ``self-proving'' will (must be met during the execution of the will), in which case witness testimony may be forgone during probate. Often there is a time limit, usually 30 days, within which a will must be admitted to probate. In some jurisdictions, only an original will may be admitted to probate--even the most accurate photocopy will not suffice. Some jurisdictions will admit a copy of a will if the original was lost or accidentally destroyed and the validity of the copy can be proved to the satisfaction of the court. If the will is ruled invalid in probate, then inheritance will occur under the laws of intestacy as if a will were never drafted.

The verse is based on the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18. The chorus is borrowed from the song ``Let's Pretend'', which Carmen wrote and recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. The song was the first released on Carmen's first solo LP after leaving the power pop group the Raspberries and was released as the first single in December 1975, to great acclaim. It reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 1 on Cash Box Top 100 Singles and number 3 in Canada. The single sold more than one million copies in the United States and was certified gold by the RIAA in April 1976. ``All By Myself'' was Carmen's first of eight US Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, this was his only Top 40 success, peaking at number 12. In a 2006 poll for UK's Five programme Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs, Eric Carmen's version of this song was voted seventeenth. Rachmaninoff's music was in the public domain in the United States and Carmen thought no copyright existed on it, but it was still protected outside the U.S. Subsequent to the release of the album, he was contacted by the Rachmaninoff estate and informed otherwise. An agreement was reached in which the estate would receive 12 percent of the royalties from ``All by Myself'' as well as from ``Never Gonna Fall in Love Again'', which was based on the third movement from Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Carmen has stated that he also incorporated part of another melody into this song. The melody was taken from his previous hit with the Raspberries, ``Let's Pretend.'' Carmen's original version has spawned numerous cover versions by such artists as Rico J. Puno in 1976, Celine Dion in 1996, Frank Sinatra, Igudesman& Joo, Il Divo, and Only Men Aloud!. The slide guitar solo was performed by famed studio guitarist Hugh McCracken.

It was the fourth (or third, depending on the country) hit single from her album Falling into You. Produced by David Foster at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas, it was released on October 7, 1996 in Europe, January 13, 1997 in Australia, and March 11, 1997 in North America. There were three music videos made. The first one was released in October 1996. It contains fragments from Dion's photo session for the Falling into You album cover and some scenes from her Live \u00e0 Paris concert. It was made for the single version and it was directed by Nigel Dick. The second version was made for the UK market with the same white T-shirt scenes but adding footage of a young couple in love at Christmas time, instead of scenes from Dion's concert. This was made for the album version. Finally, a live music video was released in March 1997 in North America (from the 1996 concert in Montreal). Dion performed this song many times during world tours, TV shows and music events such as the Grammy Awards (1997), Billboard Music Awards (1997) and Bambi Awards (1996). A performance from her 2008-2009 Taking Chances Tour can be found on the Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert DVD/ CD. It is currently included in the set list of Dion's Las Vegas residency show C\u00e9line which premiered on March 15, 2011. The song was also performed during the 2013 Sans attendre Tour; the Quebec City performance was included in the C\u00e9line... une seule fois/ Live 2013 CD/ DVD. The song was also performed in Dion's 2017 European tour. Dion also recorded a Spanish version of ``All by Myself,'' called ``Sola otra vez'' (English: By Myself Again). It was added to the Falling into You Latin American/ Spanish edition, and as a B-side to other singles from that album. This version became available worldwide on Dion's later compilation The Collector's Series, Volume One. The CD single was released in 1996 in Brazil only. Dion's ``Sola otra vez'' was selected the number one Spanish language cover of an English pop song by TheSpanishVersion.Org. The ``All by Myself'' single became one of Dion's biggest hits in the United States, reaching number 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks (for three weeks) and the Latin Pop Airplay (two weeks). It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 (number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number 5 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales). It was also a top 10 hit in France, United Kingdom, Wallonia in Belgium and the Republic of Ireland. In Canada, ``All by Myself'' was released as a promotional single only, hitting number 1 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. ``All by Myself'' was certified gold in the US (500,000), and silver in the UK (200,000) and France (165,000). The track was included on some editions of Dion's greatest hits All the Way... A Decade of Song in 1999 and on My Love: Essential Collection in 2008. This version also features on the ITV game show Take Me Out if the contestant leaves the show without a date. Critical reception (edit) Dion's cover received positive reviews. New York Times editor Stephen Holden wrote that the remake, along with ``Because You Loved Me,'' ``are the strongest cuts on an album crammed with formulaic romantic bombast.'' Music.uk.launch.yahoo.com editor Dan Leroy wrote: ``Trying to out-emote Eric Carmen was almost crazy enough to work.'' Entertainment Weekly editor Chuck Eddy said:''... But only in her desolate cover of Eric Carmen's All by Myself does she truly crash through the glass ceiling of passion.''

Her version reached# 100 in Australia in November 1994, and# 26 in New Zealand in March 1995. The 2001 motion picture Bridget Jones's Diary featured a cover version performed by JamieO'Neal showing actress Ren\u00e9e Zellweger singing to it in the famous pajamas scene. This track is also played over the other Bridget Jones films Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and Bridget Jones's Baby. In 2008, the male voice choir Only Men Aloud! covered the song on their self-named album and also released it as a single. Use in popular culture (edit) The Carmen version is used in the video introduction for ConanO'Brien's ``Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour'', when an obese and bearded version of the talk show host struggles to cope with losing his job as host of Tonight Show. The Carmen version is also featured in the second season's episode 17 of the popular 1990s sitcom Friends (set on Joey& Chandler's friendship), and a season 4 episode of the hit sitcom That '70s Show whereas Eric Forman breaks up with Donna Pinciotti. It was also featured in the films Under Wraps, Bridget Jones 'Diary and To Die For. The version is used also in the film I nuovi mostri directed by Dino Risi, with Ornella Muti and Yorgo Voyagis. In the Disney film Zootopia, a snippet is heard of it as the main character, Judy Hopps, browses through one depressing song after another on her clock radio. A character is featured performing the song as karaoke in the 2001 Angel episode ``Happy Anniversary''. The song was used in advertisements: Toyota Soarer, Japan, 1991 Honda CR-V Second Generation, Thailand, 2002 Visine ``Distance'' version, Indonesia, 2011 See also (edit) Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1976 Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1997 List of Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles in 1997 List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1997 (U.S.) List of number-one Billboard Hot Latin Pop Airplay of 1997 List of UK top 10 singles in 1996 References (edit) Jump up^ Hogya, Bernie (2005). ``'' All By Myself'' 30th Anniversary ``.

Caroline Wozniacki became the first Danish player to win a Grand Slam singles title, defeating Simona Halep in the final, 7--6, 3--6, 6--4. Wozniacki also regained the WTA no. 1 singles ranking for the first time since 2012. Both finalists saved match points earlier in the tournament: Halep saved three match points against Lauren Davis in the third round and two match points against Angelique Kerber in the semifinals, while Wozniacki saved two match points against Jana Fett in the second round. In addition to Wozniacki and Halep, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, Elina Svitolina, Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and Je\u013cena Ostapenko were also in contention for the no. 1 singles ranking at the start of the tournament. The third round match between Halep and Davis lasted 48 games, tying Chanda Rubin and Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario's 1996 quarterfinal match for the Australian Open's record for most games played in a women's match. At 15 years and 6 months old, Marta Kostyuk became the youngest player to win a main draw match at the Australian Open since Martina Hingis in 1996 and the youngest to reach the third round at any Grand Slam event since Mirjana Lu\u010di\u0107-Baroni at the 1997 US Open. Kostyuk was the youngest player to qualify for a Grand Slam main draw since Sesil Karatantcheva at the 2005 Australian Open.

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed. This model, known as the nebular hypothesis and now refined as the Nice model (2005), was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990's, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations. The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets often shifted due to gravitational interactions. This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution. In roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.

The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of heliocentrism, which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the Earth in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia (Aristarchus of Samos had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term ``Solar System'' dates from 1704. The current standard theory for Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to itsre-acceptance. Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems. Formation (edit) See also: Nebular hypothesisPre-solar nebula (edit) The nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant molecular cloud. The cloud was about 20 parsec (65 light years) across, while the fragments were roughly 1 parsec (three and a quarter light-years) across. The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01--0.1 pc (2,000--20,000 AU) in size. One of these collapsing fragments (known as thepre-solar nebula) formed what became the Solar System. The composition of this region with a mass just over that of the Sun (M) was about the same as that of the Sun today, with hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of lithium produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, forming about 98% of its mass. The remaining 2% of the mass consisted of heavier elements that were created by nucleosynthesis in earlier generations of stars. Late in the life of these stars, they ejected heavier elements into the interstellar medium. Hubble image of protoplanetary discs in the Orion Nebula, a light-years-wide ``stellar nursery'' probably very similar to the primordial nebula from which the Sun formed The oldest inclusions found in meteorites, thought to trace the first solid material to form in thepre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae occurred near the Sun while it was forming. A shock wave from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse. Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the Orion Nebula. Studies of the structure of the Kuiper belt and of anomalous materials within it suggest that the Sun formed within a cluster of between1,000 and10,000 stars with a diameter of between 6.5 and 19.5 light years and a collective mass of3,000 M. This cluster began to break apart between 135 million and 535 million years after formation. Several simulations of our young Sun interacting with close-passing stars over the first 100 million years of its life produce anomalous orbits observed in the outer Solar System, such as detached objects. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200 AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre. At this point in its evolution, the Sun is thought to have been a T Tauri star. Studies of T Tauri stars show that they are often accompanied by discs ofpre-planetary matter with masses of 0.001--0.1 M. These discs extend to several hundred AU--the Hubble Space Telescope has observed protoplanetary discs of up to 1000 AU in diameter in star-forming regions such as the Orion Nebula--and are rather cool, reaching a surface temperature of only about 1000 kelvin at their hottest. Within 50 million years, the temperature and pressure at the core of the Sun became so great that its hydrogen began to fuse, creating an internal source of energy that countered gravitational contraction until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved. This marked the Sun's entry into the prime phase of its life, known as the main sequence. Main-sequence stars derive energy from the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores. The Sun remains a main-sequence star today. Formation of the planets (edit) See also: Protoplanetary disk Artist's conception of the solar nebula The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of~ 10 kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years. The inner Solar System, the region of the Solar System inside 4 AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like iron, nickel, and aluminium) and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (M) and ceased accumulating matter about100,000 years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see Terrestrial planets below). When the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 M within about 3 million years. Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun. Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at~ 5 AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of 10 M, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate. Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150 Earth masses~ 10 years thereafter and finally topping out at 318 M. Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume. T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger stellar winds than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong solar wind had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, the planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium--not more than 1 M each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores. The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete. This means that Uranus and Neptune may have formed closer to the Sun--near or even between Jupiter and Saturn--and later migrated or were ejected outward (see Planetary migration below). Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the Stardust sample return from Comet Wild 2 has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt. After between three and ten million years, the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets. Subsequent evolution (edit) Artist's conception of the giant impact thought to have formed the Moon The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets-the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth. However, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun. Terrestrial planets (edit) At the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50--100 Moon-to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100 million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury. One unresolved issue with this model is that it can not explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today. One hypothesis for this ``eccentricity dumping'' is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The ``gravitational drag'' of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets 'energy, smoothing out their orbits. However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets 'orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place. Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets 'gravity, formed a region of higher density, a ``gravitational wake'', in the larger objects 'path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits. Asteroid belt (edit) The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4 AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2--3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20--30 Moon-to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3 million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and played a role in the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals. This is still 10--20 times more than the current mass in the main belt, which is now about 1/2,000 M. A secondary depletion period that brought the asteroid belt down close to its present mass is thought to have followed when Jupiter and Saturn entered a temporary 2: 1 orbital resonance (see below). The inner Solar System's period of giant impacts probably played a role in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~ 6\u00d7 10 kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System. The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted. Planetary migration (edit) Main articles: Nice model and Grand tack hypothesis According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the ``wrong place''. Uranus and Neptune (known as the ``ice giants'') exist in a region where the reduced density of the solar nebula and longer orbital times render their formation highly implausible. The two are instead thought to have formed in orbits near Jupiter and Saturn, where more material was available, and to have migrated outward to their current positions over hundreds of millions of years. Simulation showing outer planets and Kuiper belt: a) Before Jupiter/ Saturn 2: 1 resonance b) Scattering of Kuiper belt objects into the Solar System after the orbital shift of Neptune c) After ejection of Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter The migration of the outer planets is also necessary to account for the existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55 AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100 AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about50,000 AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30 AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15--20 AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune. According to the Nice model, after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500--600 million years (about 4 billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2: 1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits. This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt. The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets 'orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again. In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts. Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the Grand tack hypothesis), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5 AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2: 3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets. However, it is unclear whether conditions in the solar nebula would have allowed Jupiter and Saturn to move back to their current positions, and according to current estimates this possibility appears unlikely. Moreover, alternative explanations for the small mass of Mars exist.

Created50,000 years ago by an impactor about 50 metres (160 ft) across, it shows that the accretion of the Solar System is not over. Gravitational disruption from the outer planets 'migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4 billion years ago, 500--600 million years after the formation of the Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8 billion years ago--almost immediately after the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment. Impacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker--Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth. Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium. The evolution of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity. Moons (edit) See also: Giant-impact hypothesis Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These natural satellites originated by one of three possible mechanisms:Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets); Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and Capture of a passing object. Jupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as Io, Europa, Ganymede and Titan, which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun. This origin is indicated by the large sizes of the moons and their proximity to the planet. These attributes are impossible to achieve via capture, while the gaseous nature of the primaries also make formation from collision debris unlikely. The outer moons of the giant planets tend to be small and have eccentric orbits with arbitrary inclinations. These are the characteristics expected of captured bodies. Most such moons orbit in the direction opposite the rotation of their primary. The largest irregular moon is Neptune's moon Triton, which is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object. Moons of solid Solar System bodies have been created by both collisions and capture. Mars's two small moons, Deimos and Phobos, are thought to be captured asteroids. The Earth's Moon is thought to have formed as a result of a single, large head-on collision. The impacting object probably had a mass comparable to that of Mars, and the impact probably occurred near the end of the period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon. The impact was probably the last in the series of mergers that formed the Earth. It has been further hypothesized that the Mars-sized object may have formed at one of the stable Earth--Sun Lagrangian points (either L or L) and drifted from its position. The moons of trans-Neptunian objects Pluto (Charon) and Orcus (Vanth) may also have formed by means of a large collision: the Pluto--Charon, Orcus--Vanth and Earth--Moon systems are unusual in the Solar System in that the satellite's mass is at least 1% that of the larger body. Future (edit) Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then. Long-term Stability (edit) Main article: Stability of the Solar System The Solar System is chaotic over million-and billion-year timescales, with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune--Pluto system, which lies in a 3: 2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10--20 million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now. The outer planets 'orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2--230 million years. In all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets 'orbits becoming significantly more--or less--elliptical. Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within five billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it on a collision course with Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed. Moon--ring systems (edit) The evolution of moon systems is driven by tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time. The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. In about 50 billion years, if they survive the Sun's expansion, the Earth and Moon will become tidally locked to each other; each will be caught up in what is called a ``spin--orbit resonance'' in which the Moon will circle the Earth in about 47 days and both Moon and Earth will rotate around their axes in the same time, each only visible from one hemisphere of the other. Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons) and most of the larger moons of Saturn. Neptune and its moon Triton, taken by Voyager 2. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's Roche limit, tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system. A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30 to 50 million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons. A third possibility is where the primary and moon are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration. Prior to the 2004 arrival of the Cassini--Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300 million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings 'outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10 km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5 billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come. The Sun and planetary environments (edit) See also: Stellar evolution and Future of Earth In the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1 billion years. In one billion years 'time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life on land will become extinct. Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans 'surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner. During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life. By 3.5 billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today. Relative size of the Sun as it is now (inset) compared to its estimated future size as a red giant Around 5.4 billion years from now, the core of the Sun will become hot enough to trigger hydrogen fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5 billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2 AU--256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, as a result of the vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600 K) than now and its luminosity much higher--up to2,700 current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life. As the Sun expands, it will swallow the planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; although the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) will cause the planets 'orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up as a result of tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope. Gradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11 times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770 K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100 million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500 K. This phase lasts about 30 million years, after which, over the course of a further100,000 years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars. The Ring nebula, a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will become This is a relatively peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100 times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer. As the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss. All remaining planets 'orbits will expand; if Venus, Earth, and Mars still exist, their orbits will lie roughly at 1.4 AU (210,000,000 km), 1.9 AU (280,000,000 km), and 2.8 AU (420,000,000 km). They and the other remaining planets will become dark, frigid hulks, completely devoid of any form of life. They will continue to orbit their star, their speed slowed due to their increased distance from the Sun and the Sun's reduced gravity. Two billion years later, when the Sun has cooled to the 6000--8000K range, the carbon and oxygen in the Sun's core will freeze, with over 90% of its remaining mass assuming a crystalline structure. Eventually, after billions more years, the Sun will finally cease to shine altogether, becoming a black dwarf. Galactic interaction (edit) Location of the Solar System within the Milky Way The Solar System travels alone through the Milky Way in a circular orbit approximately30,000 light years from the Galactic Centre. Its speed is about 220 km/ s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the galactic year, is in the range of 220--250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions. Various scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of mass extinctions observed in the Earth's fossil record. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker; as itre-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20--25 million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger ``disc tides'', which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact. However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position can not alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae. Galactic collision and planetary disruption (edit) Main article: Andromeda--Milky Way collision Although the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120 km/ s. In 4 billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies 'supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions. It is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way--Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed. However, over time, the cumulative probability of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1 quadrillion (10) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist. Chronology (edit) The time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6 billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are approximately 4.4 billion years old. Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6 billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old. Studies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10 million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming. Timeline of Solar System evolution (edit) A graphical timeline is available at Graphical timeline of Earth and Sun Note: All dates and times in this chronology are approximate and should be taken as an order of magnitude indicator only.

It is the standard unit of measurement for interplanetary distances. Jump up^ The combined mass of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is 445.6 Earth masses. The mass of remaining material is~ 5.26 Earth masses or 1.1% (see Solar System# Notes and List of Solar System objects by mass) Jump up^ The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being ejected from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent. Jump up^ In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.

Neuman on Mad 30 Alfred E. Neuman is the fictitious mascot and cover boy of the American humor magazine Mad. The character's face had drifted through U.S. iconography for decades before being claimed by Mad editor Harvey Kurtzman in 1954 and later named by the magazine's second editor Al Feldstein in 1956. Since his debut in Mad, Neuman's likeness has appeared on the cover of all but a handful of the magazine's 550+ issues, distinguished by jug ears, a missing front tooth, and one eye lower than the other. His face is rarely seen in profile; he has virtually always been shown in front view, directly from behind, or in silhouette. Contents (hide) 1 History 2 Genesis 3 Cultural impact 4 References 5 External links History (edit) Harvey Kurtzman first spotted the image on a postcard pinned to the office bulletin board of Ballantine Books editor Bernard Shir-Cliff. ``It was a face that didn't have a care in the world, except mischief'', recalled Kurtzman. Shir-Cliff was later a contributor to various magazines created by Kurtzman. In November 1954, Neuman made his Mad debut on the front cover of Ballantine's The Mad Reader, a paperback collection of reprints from the first two years of Mad. The character's first appearance in the comic book was on the cover of Mad# 21 (March 1955), in a tiny image as part of a mock advertisement. A rubber mask bearing his likeness with ``idiot'' written underneath was offered for$1.29. First cover appearance of Neuman, on Mad# 21 (third from viewer's left of the six faces approx. 40% down the viewer's-right side) Mad switched to a magazine format starting with issue# 24, and Neuman's face appeared in the top, central position of the illustrated border used on the covers, with his now-familiar signature phrase ``What, me worry?'' written underneath. Initially, the phrase was rendered ``What? Me worry?'' These borders were used for five more issues, through Mad# 30 (December 1956). The character was also shown on page 9 of Mad# 24 as ``Melvin Coznowski'' and on page 65 as ``Melvin Sturdley''. In later issues he appeared as ``Melvin Cowsnofsky'' or ``Mel Haney''. In Mad# 25, the face and name were shown together on separate pages as both Neuman and Mel Haney. The crowded cover shot on Mad# 27 marked Neuman's first color appearance. When Al Feldstein took over as Mad's editor in 1956, he seized upon the face: I decided that I wanted to have this visual logo as the image of Mad, the same way that corporations had the Jolly Green Giant and the dog barking (sic) at the gramophone for RCA. This kid was the perfect example of what I wanted. So I put an ad in The New York Times that said, ``National magazine wants portrait artist for special project''. In walked this little old guy in his sixties named Norman Mingo, and he said, ``What national magazine is this?'' I said ``Mad,'' and he said, ``Goodbye.'' I told him to wait, and I dragged out all these examples and postcards of this idiot kid, and I said, ``I want a definitive portrait of this kid. I don't want him to look like an idiot--I want him to be loveable and have an intelligence behind his eyes. But I want him to have this devil-may-care attitude, someone who can maintain a sense of humor while the world is collapsing around him.'' I adapted and used that portrait, and that was the beginning. Mingo's defining portrait was used on the cover of Mad# 30 in late 1956 as a supposed write-in candidate for the Presidency, and fixed his identity and appearance into the version that has been used ever since. In November 2008, Mingo's original cover art featuring this first official portrait of Neuman sold at auction for$203,150. Mingo painted seven more Neuman covers through 1957, and later returned to become the magazine's signature cover artist throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Mingo produced 97 Mad covers in total, and also illustrated dozens of additional cover images for Mad's many reprint Specials and its line of paperbacks. During Mingo's absence, Frank Kelly Freas rendered Neuman for Mad from 1958 to 1962. Mingo's total surpassed Freas 'in 1965, and his leading status endured until 2016, when current contributor Mark Fredrickson became the most prolific Mad cover artist with his 98th cover. Neuman has appeared in one form or another on the cover of nearly every issue of Mad and its spinoffs since that issue and continuing to the present day, with a small handful of exceptions. Two such departures were Mad# 233 (September 1982) which replaced Neuman's image with that of Pac-Man, and Mad# 195 (December 1977) which instead featured the message ``Pssst! Keep This Issue Out of the Hands of Your Parents! (Make 'Em Buy Their Own Copy!)''. Even when Neuman is not part of the cover gag, or when the cover is entirely text-based, his disembodied head generally appears in miniature form. The most notorious Neuman-free cover was# 166 (April 1974), which featured a human hand giving the profane ``middle finger'' gesture while declaring Mad to be ``The Number One Ecch Magazine''. Some newsstands that normally carried Mad chose not to display or sell this issue. Conversely, the two covers that featured Neuman the most times were# 502 (January 2010), and# 400 (December 2000).# 502 featured a human hand giving the ``thumb's down'' signal, while wearing a silver-spangled glove in the style of singer Michael Jackson. Each individual spangle, more than 300 in all, was a tiny Alfred E. Neuman face. The cover of issue# 400 was a photomosaic of Neuman's face, composed of more than2,700 images of previous Mad covers. Neuman's ubiquity as a grinning cover boy grew as the magazine's circulation quadrupled, but the single highest-selling issue of Mad depicted only his feet. The cover image of issue# 161, spoofing the 1973 film The Poseidon Adventure, showed Neuman floating upside-down inside a life preserver. The original art for this cover was purchased at auction in 1992 for$2,200 by Annie Gaines, the widow of Mad founder and publisher William Gaines, and subsequently given on permanent loan to Mad writer Dick DeBartolo. The image was copied in 1998 for issue# 369 spoofing the hit film Titanic. A female version of Neuman named Moxie Cowznofski appeared briefly during the late 1950s, occasionally described in editorial text as Neuman's ``girlfriend''. Neuman and Moxie were sometimes depicted side-by-side, defeating any speculation that Moxie was possibly Neuman in female guise. Her name was inspired by Moxie, a soft drink manufactured in Portland, Maine, which was sold nationwide in the 1950s and whose logo appeared as a running visual gag in many early issues of Mad. In late 1959, Mad released a 45 rpm single entitled ``What--Me Worry?'' on ABC Paramount 12013 that was credited to Neuman, and featured an uncredited voice actor singing the song as Neuman. (The B-side of the single, ``Potrzebie'', is an instrumental.) Mad routinely combines Neuman with another character or inanimate object for its cover images. Neuman has appeared in a slew of guises, including Santa Claus, Darth Vader, George Washington, King Kong, Baby New Year, Lawrence of Arabia, Batman, Robin, Spider-Man, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Rosemary's Baby, George S.

Since his initial unsuccessful run in 1956, Neuman has periodically beenre-offered as a candidate for President with the slogan, ``You could do worse... and always have!'' Early image of the ``Me Worry?'' kid, from the early 1950s. Along with his face, Mad also includes a short humorous quotation credited to Neuman with every issue's table of contents. (Example: ``It takes one to know one... and vice versa!'') Some of these quotations were collected in the 1997 book Mad: The Half-Wit and Wisdom of Alfred E. Neuman, which was illustrated by Sergio Aragon\u00e9s. Neuman is now used exclusively as a mascot and iconic symbol of the magazine, but before this status was codified, he was referenced in several early articles. In one, Neuman answered a letter from a suicidal reader by giving ``expert advice'' on the best technique for tying a hangman's knot. Other articles featured the school newspaper of ``Neuman High School'', and a bulletin from ``Alfred E. Neuman University''. An article entitled ``Alfred E. Neuman's Family Tree'' depicted historical versions of Neuman from various eras. Since then, Neuman has appeared only occasionally inside the magazine's articles. A recurring article titled ``Poor Alfred's Almanac'' showed his face atop the page, but otherwise the character had no role in the text. In a 1968 article, Neuman's face was assembled, feature by feature, from parts of photographs of well-known politicos, including then-President Lyndon B. Johnson (left ear), Richard Nixon (nose), Oregon Governor Mark Hatfield (eyes), and Ronald Reagan (hair). The gap in his teeth (which was otherwise the grin of Dwight D. Eisenhower) came from ``The 'Credibility Gap 'Created by Practically All Politicians''. Neuman's famous motto is the intellectually uncurious ``What, me worry?'' This was changed for one issue to ``Yes, me worry!'' after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. On the cover of current printings of the paperback The Ides of Mad, as rendered by long-time cover artist Norman Mingo, Neuman is portrayed as a Roman bust with his catch phrase engraved on the base, translated into Latin--Quid, Me Anxius Sum? Neuman's surname is often misspelled as ``Newman''. Neuman's most prominent physical feature is his gap-toothed grin, with a few notable exceptions. On the cover of issue# 236 (January 1983), Neuman was featured with E.T. theExtra-Terrestrial. The cover showed E.T. using his famous ``healing finger'' to touch Neuman's mouth and cause the missing tooth to appear. The cover of issue# 411 (November 2001), the first to be produced following the 9/ 11 attacks in the United States, showed a close-up of Neuman's face, but his gap was now filled with an American flag. A text gag on the cover of issue# 263 (June 1986) claimed that the UPC was really a ``Close-up Photograph of Neuman's Missing Tooth''. Neuman also appeared as himself in a political cartoon, after Newsweek had been criticized for using computer graphics to retouch the teeth of Bobbi McCaughey. The cartoon was rendered in the form of a split-screen comparison, in which Neuman was featured on the cover of Mad with his usual gap-toothed grin, then also featured on the cover of Newsweek, but with a perfect smile. Despite the primacy of Neuman's incomplete smile, his other facial features have occasionally attracted notice. Artist Andy Warhol said that seeing Neuman taught him to love people with big ears. In 1958, Mad published letters from several readers noting the resemblance between Neuman and England's Prince Charles, then nine years old. Shortly thereafter, an angry letter under a Buckingham Palace letterhead arrived at the Mad offices: ``Dear Sirs No it isn't a bit--not the least little bit like me. So jolly well stow it! See! Charles. P.'' The letter was authenticated as having been written on triple-cream laid royal stationery bearing an official copper-engraved crest. The postmark indicated it had been mailed from a post office within a short walking distance of Buckingham Palace. Unfortunately, the original disappeared years ago while on loan to another magazine and has never been recovered. For many years, Mad sold prints of the official portrait of Neuman through a small house ad on the letters page of the magazine. In the early years, the price was one for 25 cents; three for 50 cents; nine for a dollar; or 27 for two dollars. The ad stated that the prints could also be used for wrapping fish. A live-action version of Neuman--an uncredited actor wearing a mask--appears briefly in the 1980 film Up the Academy which was originally released to theaters as Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy. Mad later pulled its support from the film, and all footage of the Neuman character was excised from North American home video and television releases, although it was reinstated for the 2006 DVD release. Neuman appeared occasionally in the early seasons of MADtv during sketches and interstitials, and briefly appeared in the animated TV series Mad. Genesis (edit) The New Boy--1894 Neuman's precise origin is shrouded in mystery and may never be fully known. A comprehensive collection of early Neumanesque images can be found in Maria Reidelbach's comprehensive work, Completely Mad: A History of the Comic Book and Magazine (Little, Brown, 1991). Mad publisher Bill Gaines gave Reidelbach total access to the magazine's own files, including the collection of Neuman-related images that had been assembled for a 1965 copyright infringement lawsuit. The earliest image cited in Reidelbach's book is from an advertisement for Atmore's Mince Meat, Genuine English Plum Pudding. She wrote that, ``(d) ating from 1895, this is the oldest verified image of the boy... The kid's features are fully developed and unmistakable, and the image was very likely taken from an older archetype...'' After the publication of the book, an older ``archetype'' was discovered in an advertisement for the comical stage play, The New Boy, which debuted on Broadway in 1894. The image is nearly identical to what later appears in the Atmore's ads. An example of the stage play's advertisement was published in the Los Angeles Herald (December 2, 1894). Using words that could easily be describing the character of Alfred E. Neuman, the paper reported that the, ``comic red-headed urchin with a joyous grin all over his freckled face, whose phiz ((face)) is the trademark of the comedy, is so expressive of the rollicking and ridiculous that the New York Herald and the Evening Telegram have applied it to political cartoon purposes.'' Elements of the plot of the play explain why the character has adult and childlike features, why the character is dressed as he is, and how he may have lost his teeth. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, the original New Boy image was published with a two-part phrase that is similar in tone to Neuman's, ``What? Me Worry?'' catch phrase. The catch phrase for The New Boy, was, ``What's the good of anything?--Nothing!'' The New Boy advertising image was copied widely for use as advertising for ``painless'' dentistry advertisements and other uses. It is also possible that the image influenced the look of The Yellow Kid, the 1890s character from Richard F. Outcault's strip, Hogan's Alley. The image was used for a variety of purposes nearly continuously until it was adopted by Mad Magazine. The Yellow Kid, 1897. 1908 Antikamnia Tablet Calendar. Postcard from 1930 to 1945 with a similar boy and slogan to Mad Magazine's Neuman. Similar faces turned up in advertising for ``painless'' dentistry. A face virtually identical to Neuman's appears in the 1923 issue of the University of Minnesota humor magazine The Guffer above the caption ``Medic After Passing Con Exam in P. Chem.'' Another identical face shows up in the logo for Happy Jack Beverages, a soda drink produced by the A.B. Cook company in 1939. An almost-identical image appeared as ``nose art'' on an American World War II bomber, over the motto ``Me Worry?'' (this painted face was sometimes referred to as ``The Jolly Boy''). Neuman's image was also used negatively, as a ``supporter'' of rival political candidates, with the idea that only an idiot would vote for them. In 1940, those opposing Franklin Delano Roosevelt's third-term reelection bid distributed postcards with a similar caricature bearing the caption, ``Sure I'm for Roosevelt''. In some instances, there was also the implication that the ``idiot'' was in fact a Jewish caricature. Carl Djerassi's autobiography claims that in Vienna after the Anschluss, he saw posters with a similar face and the caption Tod den Juden (``Kill the Jews''). Since the EC editors had grown up listening to radio, this was frequently reflected in their stories, names and references. The name ``Alfred E. Neuman'' derived from comedian Henry Morgan's ``Here's Morgan'' radio series on Mutual, ABC and NBC. One character on his show had a name that was a reference to composer Alfred Newman, who scored many films and also composed the familiar fanfare that accompanies 20th Century Fox's opening film logo. The possible inspiration for Henry Morgan was that Laird Cregar portrayed Sir Henry Morgan in The Black Swan (1942) with Tyrone Power, and the Oscar-nominated score for that film was by Newman. Listening to the sarcastic Morgan's brash broadcasts, the Mad staff took note and reworked the name into Neuman, as later recalled by Kurtzman: The name Alfred E. Neuman was picked up from Alfred Newman, the music arranger from back in the 1940s and 1950s. Actually, we borrowed the name indirectly through The Henry Morgan Show. He was using the name Newman for an innocuous character that you'd forget in five minutes. So we started using the name Alfred Neuman. The readers insisted on putting the name and the face together, and they would call the ``What, Me Worry?'' face Alfred Neuman. Morgan later became a Mad contributor, with ``The Truth about Cowboys'' in issue# 33. When Mad was sued for copyright infringement by a woman claiming to hold the rights to the image, the magazine argued that it had copied the picture from various materials dating back to 1911 (whichpre-dated the plaintiff's own claim). The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and the boy's face is now permanently associated with Mad--so much so, in fact, that according to Mad writer Frank Jacobs, the US Post Office once delivered a letter to the Mad offices bearing only a picture of Neuman, without any other address or identifying features. In 2008, Eastern Michigan University held an exhibit and symposium on the evolution of Neuman images, dating back to 1877. Several pre--New Boy images that bear some resemblance to Neuman have also been identified. A number may be seen on John Adcock's Mysteries of Melvin blog-posting and another at leconcombre.com. The earlier images, however, do not share the missing teeth/ tooth or the head-and-shoulders framing and head-on pose. In 2012, longtime editor Nick Meglin offered a streamlined, exasperated version of Neuman's origins: Oh, don't ask me about Alfred E. Neuman. That story is so old and so meaningless. Does the average Playboy reader care about where the rabbit came from? It's just a symbol that lets you know what's on the inside. It's just a name we made up. We had 20, and that's the one we settled on. Cultural impact (edit) Over the decades, Neuman has frequently been referenced in outside media, and his face has often appeared in political cartoons as a shorthand for unquestioning stupidity. During the administration of United States President George W. Bush, Neuman's features were frequently merged with those of Bush by editorial cartoonists such as Mike Luckovich and Tom Tomorrow. The image has also appeared on magazine covers, notably The Nation. A large Bush/ Neuman poster was part of the Washington protests that accompanied Bush's 2001 inauguration. The alleged resemblance between the two has been noted more than once by Hillary Clinton. On July 10, 2005, speaking at the Aspen Institute's Ideas Festival, she said, ``I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington,'' referring to Bush's purported ``What, me worry?'' attitude. At the October 2008 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama joked, ``It's often been said that I share the politics of Alfred E. Smith and the ears of Neuman.'' Neuman's features have also been compared to others in the public eye, including Prince Charles, Ted Koppel, Oliver North and David Letterman. Freas painted the August 1971 cover of National Lampoon which merged Neuman's features with those of the court-martialed Vietnam War murderer William Calley, complete with the phrase, 'What, My Lai?'' However, Neuman's motto has also been referenced in anon-pejorative fashion, as at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969. Jimi Hendrix spoke to the audience about the various changes of personnel in his band, and their lack of rehearsal time, while saying ``What, me worry?'' The tenth American Idol winner, Scotty McCreery, has a striking resemblance to Neuman. When judge Steven Tyler pointed this out on the show, McCreery replied, ``What, me worry?'' In an extended sequence of the comic strip Peanuts from 1973 (later recreated in the 1983 TV special It's An Adventure, Charlie Brown), Charlie Brown becomes so obsessed with baseball that everything round starts looking like a baseball to him. Soon his own round head develops a rash that makes the back of his skull look like a baseball, and he starts wearing a paper bag on his head to hide it. Ironically, while hidden from view, his popularity and respect increase. He is referred to by the other campers as ``Mr. Sack'' or ``Sack'', but is also voted camp president and is widely admired. The rash eventually fades from his head, but Charlie Brown still fears that the next round thing he expects to see--a sunrise--may continue to look like a baseball. When the sun does rise, it instead looks like Neuman, with a halo reading: ``What! Me Worry?''! Neuman also appeared as a sight gag in the March 27, 1967 installment of the comic strip Beetle Bailey, as an inspector general. He can also be spotted in The Amazing Spider-Man# 300, helping Peter Parker and Mary Jane move into their new house, while saying, ``Darn! I'm missing the Nets game! That makes me Mad!'' Similarly, when, in 1959's Superman# 126, Superman decides to test Lois Lane by removing a rubber Superman mask in order to reveal his ``real'' identity, his identity is none other than Neuman. DC Comics '``Emperor Joker'' storyline includes a cult that worships a deity named Alfred E.; the high priest of this cult wears a mask identical to Neuman's face. Neuman and Mad have been referenced several times on the animated series The Simpsons. In the episode ``Marge in Chains'', Marge is arrested and in prison she meets an inmate called Tattoo Annie who has a fold-in tattoo that reveals Neuman with the text: ``What me Worry?''. The original phrase was ``What kind of slime would I marry?''. In the episode ``The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson'', Bart comes into contact with Neuman during a visit to the Mad offices. Neuman demands to see ``Kaputnik and Fonebone'' (which are references to deceased long-time Mad artists Dave Berg and Don Martin, respectively) for their work on New Kids on the Blecch (which would later become the title of another episode), and requests some ``furshlugginer pastrami sandwiches''. An awestruck Bart announces that he will ``never wash these eyes again''. In the episode ``New Kids on the Blecch'', Bart's boy band is booked to play a gig on an aircraft carrier, but their band manager plots to use the craft's weaponry to destroy the Mad offices when he discovers the magazine plans to publish a defamatory article about the band. Mad's New York headquarters were depicted as a skyscraper similar to the Chrysler Building with a giant three-dimensional replica of Neuman's head mounted on the roof. In the episode ``Father Knows Worst'', Homer and Bart visit a hobby shop which includes an Aurora model-style kit of Neuman holding several protest signs. In a segment of his 1958 television special, Fred Astaire danced while wearing a rubber Neuman mask. An episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 made multiple references to Neuman, including episode# 602 featuring Invasion U.S.A. Upon seeing director Alfred E. Green's name in the film's opening credits, Crow T. Robot, in a slightly idiotic tone, riffs ``What? Me direct?'' An animated 1996 sketch on MADtv combining Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with The Godfather was credited to ``Alfred E. Puzo'' and ``Francis E. Neuman''. Another reworked name was ``Al Freddy Newham'', depicted on the cover of the April 1967 issue of the amateur radio enthusiast's 73 Magazine, preparing to ineptly solder the frayed cord of a soldering gun with the same damaged gun. Neuman appears briefly, in clay animated form, in Jimmy Picker's 1983 stop motion animated film, Sundae in New York. He also makes a cameo in the 1988 Daffy Duck cartoon The Night of the Living Duck. A doodle of Neuman appears on a soldier's helmet in Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam film Platoon. Lyrically, Neuman is invoked by the Beastie Boys on their song ``Shadrach'', from their second studio album, Paul's Boutique. A 1980 Password Plus episode featured Neuman's name as an answer, using the clues ``Ugly'', ``Mad'', ``Magazine'', ``Cover'', and ``Kid''. (Elaine Joyce solved the puzzle after ``Cover''). He can be glimpsed holding a fish on the cover of the album Slow Motion by Man. A statue of Neuman can be found at the Dort Mall in Flint, Michigan.

For other uses, see Jack and the Beanstalk (disambiguation). For the hero, see Jack (hero). Jack and the Beanstalk Illustration by Arthur Rackham, 1918, in English Fairy Tales by Flora Annie Steel Folk tale Name Jack and the Beanstalk Also known as Jack and the Giant man Data Aarne-Thompson grouping AT 328 (``The Treasures of the Giant'') Country England Published in Benjamin Tabart, The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk (1807) Joseph Jacobs, English Fairy Tales (1890) Related Jack the Giant Killer ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' is an English fairy tale. It appeared as ``The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean'' in 1734 and as Benjamin Tabart's moralised ``The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk'' in 1807. Henry Cole, publishing under pen name Felix Summerly popularised the tale in The Home Treasury (1845), and Joseph Jacobs rewrote it in English Fairy Tales (1890). Jacobs 'version is most commonly reprinted today and it is believed to be closer to the oral versions than Tabart's because it lacks the moralising. ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' is the best known of the ``Jack tales'', a series of stories featuring the archetypal Cornish and English hero and stock character Jack. According to researchers at the universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated more than5,000 years ago, based on a widespread archaic story form which is now classified by folkorists as ATU 328 The Boy Who Stole Ogre's Treasure. Contents (hide) 1 Story 2 Origins 3 Analogies 4 Controversy 5 Film adaptations 6 Other adaptations 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Story (edit) Jack is a young, poor boy living with his widowed mother and a dairy cow, on a farm cottage, the cow's milk was their only source of income. When the cow stops giving milk, Jack's mother tells him to take her to the market to be sold. On the way, Jack meets a bean dealer who offers magic beans in exchange for the cow, and Jack makes the trade. When he arrives home without any money, his mother becomes angry and disenchanted, throws the beans on the ground, and sends Jack to bed without dinner. During the night, the magic beans cause a gigantic beanstalk to grow outside Jack's window. The next morning, Jack climbs the beanstalk to a land high in the sky. He finds an enormous castle and sneaks in. Soon after, the castle's owner, a giant, returns home. He senses that Jack is nearby by smell, and speaks a rhyme: Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an English man: Be he alive, or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread. In the versions in which the giant's wife (the giantess) features, she persuades him that he is mistaken. When the giant falls asleep. Jack steals a bag of gold coins and makes his escape down the beanstalk. Jack climbs the beanstalk twice more. He learns of other treasures and steals them when the giant sleeps: first a goose that lays golden eggs, then a magic harp that plays by itself. The giant wakes when Jack leaves the house with the harp and chases Jack down the beanstalk. Jack calls to his mother for an axe and before the giant reaches the ground, cuts down the beanstalk, causing the giant to fall to his death. Jack and his mother live happily ever after with the riches that Jack acquired. Origins (edit) In Walter Crane's woodcut the harp reaches out to cling to the vine ``The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean'' was published in the 1734 second edition of Round About Our Coal-Fire. In 1807, Benjamin Tabart published The History of Jack and the Bean Stalk, but the story is certainly older than these accounts. According to researchers at Durham University and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the story originated more than5,000 years ago. In some versions of the tale, the giant is unnamed, but many plays based on it name him Blunderbore. (One giant of that name appears in the 18th-century ``Jack the Giant Killer''.) In ``The Story of Jack Spriggins'' the giant is named Gogmagog. The giant's cry ``Fee! Fie! Foe! Fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman'' appears in William Shakespeare's early-17th-century King Lear in the form ``Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.'' (Act 3, Scene 4), and something similar also appears in ``Jack the Giant Killer''. Analogies (edit) ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' is an Aarne-Thompson tale-type 328, The Treasures of the Giant, which includes the Italian ``Thirteenth'' and the French ``How the Dragon was Tricked'' tales. Christine Goldberg argues that the Aarne--Thompson system is inadequate for the tale because the others do not include the beanstalk, which has analogies in other types (a possible reference to the genre anomaly.) The Brothers Grimm drew an analogy between this tale and a German fairy tale, ``The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs''. The devil's mother or grandmother acts much like the giant's wife, a female figure protecting the child from the evil male figure. ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' is unusual in some versions in that the hero, although grown up, does not marry at the end but returns to his mother. In other versions he is said to have married a princess. This is found in few other tales, such as some variants of ``Vasilisa the Beautiful''. Controversy (edit) The original story portrays a ``hero'' gaining the sympathy of a man's wife, hiding in his house, robbing, and finally killing him. In Tabart's moralised version, a fairy woman explains to Jack that the giant had robbed and killed his father justifying Jack's actions as retribution. (Andrew Lang follows this version in the Red Fairy Book of 1890.) Jacobs gave no justification because there was none in the version he had heard as a child and maintained that children know that robbery and murder are wrong without being told in a fairy tale, but did give a subtle retributive tone to it by making reference to the giant's previous meals of stolen oxen and young children. Many modern interpretations have followed Tabart and made the giant a villain, terrorising smaller folk and stealing from them, so that Jack becomes a legitimate protagonist. For example, the 1952 film starring Abbott and Costello the giant is blamed for poverty at the foot of the beanstalk, as he has been stealing food and wealth and the hen that lays golden eggs originally belonged to Jack's family. In other versions it is implied that the giant had stolen both the hen and the harp from Jack's father. Brian Henson's 2001 TV miniseries Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story not only abandons Tabart's additions but vilifies Jack, reflecting Jim Henson's disgust at Jack's unscrupulous actions. Film adaptations (edit) Jack and the Beanstalk (1917) The first film adaptation was made in 1902 by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. Walt Disney made a short of the same name in 1922, and a separate adaptation titled Mickey and the Beanstalk in 1947 as part of Fun and Fancy Free. This adaptation of the story put Mickey Mouse in the role of Jack, accompanied by Donald Duck, and Goofy. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy live on a farm in ``Happy Valley'', so called because it is always green and prosperous thanks to the magical singing from an enchanted golden harp in a castle, until one day it mysteriously disappears during a dark storm, resulting in the valley being plagued by a severe drought. Times become so hard for Mickey and his friends that soon they have nothing to eat except one loaf of bread. Mickey trades in the cow (which Donald was going to kill for food) for the magic beans. Donald throws the beans on the floor and down a knothole in a fit of rage, and the beanstalk sprouts that night, lifting the three of them into the sky while they sleep. In the magical kingdom, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy help themselves to a sumptuous feast. This rouses the ire of the giant (named ``Willie'' in this version), who captures Donald and Goofy and locks them in a box, and it is up to Mickey to find the keys to unlock the box and rescue them as well as the harp which they also find in the giant's possession. The film villainizes the giant by blaming Happy Valley's hard times on Willy's theft of the magic harp, without which song the land withers; unlike the harp of the original tale, this magic harp wants to be rescued from the giant, and the hapless heroes return her to her rightful place and Happy Valley to its former glory. This version of the fairy tale was narrated (as a segment of Fun and Fancy Free) by Edgar Bergen, and later (by itself as a short) by Sterling Holloway. Additionally, Walt Disney Animation Studios will do another adaptation of the fairy tale called Gigantic. Tangled director Nathan Greno will direct and it is set to be released in late 2020 Warner Bros. adapted the story into three Merrie Melodies cartoons. Friz Freleng directed Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk (1943), Chuck Jones directed Beanstalk Bunny (1955), and Freleng directed Tweety and the Beanstalk (1957). The 1952 Abbott and Costello adaptation was not the only time a comedy team was involved with the story. The Three Stooges had their own five-minute animated retelling, titled Three Jacks and a Beanstalk (1965). In 1967, Hanna-Barbera produced a live action version of Jack and the Beanstalk, with Gene Kelly as Jeremy the Peddler (who trades his magic beans for Jack's cow), Bobby Riha as Jack, Dick Beals as Jack's singing voice, Ted Cassidy as the voice of the animated giant, Janet Waldo as the voice of the animated Princess Serena, Marni Nixon as Serena's singing voice, and Marian McKnight as Jack's mother. The songs were written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen. Kelly also directed the Emmy Award-winning film. Gisaburo Sugii directed a feature-length anime telling of the story released in 1974, titled Jack to Mame no Ki. The film, a musical, was produced by Group TAC and released by Nippon Herald. The writers introduced a few new characters, including Jack's comic-relief dog, Crosby, and Margaret, a beautiful princess engaged to be married to the giant (named ``Tulip'' in this version) due to a spell being cast over her by the giant's mother (an evil witch called Madame Hecuba). Jack, however, develops a crush on Margaret, and one of his aims in returning to the magic kingdom is to rescue her. The film was dubbed into English, with legendary voice talent Billie Lou Watt voicing Jack, and received a very limited run in U.S. theaters in 1976. It was later released on VHS (now out of print) and aired several times on HBO in the 1980s. However, it is now available on DVD with both English and Japanese dialogue. Michael Davis directed the 1994 adaptation, titled Beanstalk, starring J.D. Daniels as Jack and Stuart Pankin as the giant. The film was released by Moonbeam Entertainment, the children's video division of Full Moon Entertainment. Wolves, Witches and Giants Episode 9 of Season 1, Jack and the Beanstalk, broadcast on 19 October 1995, has Jack's mother chop down the beanstalk and the giant plummet through the earth to Australia. The hen that Jack has stolen fails to lay any eggs and ends up ``in the pot by Sunday'', leaving Jack and his mother to live in reduced circumstances for the rest of their lives. The Jim Henson Company did a TV miniseries adaptation of the story as Jim Henson's Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story (directed by Brian Henson) which reveals that Jack's theft from the giant was completely unmotivated, with the giant Thunderdell (played by Bill Barretta) being a friendly, welcoming individual, and the giant's subsequent death was caused by Jack's mother cutting the beanstalk down rather than Jack himself. The film focuses on Jack's modern-day descendant Jack Robinson (played by Matthew Modine) who learns the truth after the discovery of the giant's bones and the last of the five magic beans, Jack subsequently returning the goose and harp to the giants 'kingdom. An episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse called Donald and the Beanstalk, Donald Duck accidentally swapped his pet chicken with Willie the Giant for a handful of magic beans. Avalon Family Entertainment's film, titled Jack and the Beanstalk and released on home video April 20, 2010, is a low-budget live-action adaptation starring Christopher Lloyd, Chevy Chase, James Earl Jones, Gilbert Gottfried, Katey Sagal, Wallace Shawn and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz. Jack is played by Colin Ford. The Warner Bros. film directed by Bryan Singer and starring Nicholas Hoult as Jack is titled Jack the Giant Slayer and was released in March 2013. In this tale Jack climbs the beanstalk to save a princess. Warner Bros. Animation's direct-to-DVD film Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure is set to be based on the fairy tale. In the 2014 film Into the Woods, and the musical of the same name, one of the main characters, Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) climbs a beanstalk, much like in the original version. He acquires a golden harp, a goose that lays golden eggs, and several gold pieces. The story goes on as it does in the original fairy tale, but continues afterwards showing what happens after you get your happy ending. In this adaptation, the giant's vengeful wife (Frances de la Tour) attacks the kingdom to find and kill Jack as revenge for him murdering her husband where some characters were killed during her rampage. The giant's wife is eventually killed by the surviving characters in the story. Other adaptations (edit) The story is the basis of the similarly titled traditional British pantomime, wherein the Giant is certainly a villain, Jack's mother the Dame, and Jack the Principal Boy. Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk is the protagonist of the comic book Jack of Fables, a spin-off of Fables, which also features other elements from the story, such as giant beanstalks and giants living in the clouds. Gilligan's Island did a adaptation/ dream sequence in which Gilligan tries to take oranges from a giant Skipper and fails; (the part of the little Gilligan chased by the giant was played by Bob Denver's 7 year old son Patrick Denver) Roald Dahl rewrote the story in a more modern and gruesome way in his book Revolting Rhymes (1982), where Jack initially refuses to climb the beanstalk and his mother is thus eaten when she ascends to pick the golden leaves at the top, with Jack recovering the leaves himself after having a thorough wash so that the giant can not smell him. The story of Jack and the Beanstalk is also referenced in Dahl's The BFG, in which the evil giants are all afraid of the ``giant-killer'' Jack, who is said to kill giants with his fearsome beanstalk (although none of the giants appear to know how Jack uses it against them, the context of a nightmare one of the giants has about Jack suggesting that they think he wields the beanstalk as a weapon). James Still published Jack and the Wonder Beans (1977, republished 1996) an Appalachian variation on the Jack and the Beanstalk tale. Jack trades his old cow to a gypsy for three beans that are guaranteed to feed him for his entire life. It has been adapted as a play for performance by children. In 1973 the story was adapted, as The Goodies and the Beanstalk, by the BBC television series The Goodies. An arcade video game, Jack the Giantkiller, was released by Cinematronics in 1982 and is based on the story. Players control Jack, and must retrieve a series of treasures--a harp, a sack of gold coins, a golden goose and a princess--and eventually defeat the giant by chopping down the beanstalk. An episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, entitled ``Mario and the Beanstalk'', does a retelling with Bowser as the giant (there is no explanation as to how he becomes a giant). In The Magic School Bus episode ``Gets Planted'', the class put on a school production of Jack and the Beanstalk, with Phoebe starring as the beanstalk after Ms. Frizzle turned her into a bean plant. Jack and Beanstalk was featured in Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child where Jack is voiced by Wayne Collins and the giant is voiced by Tone Loc. The story is in an African-American style. Stephen Sondheim's musical Into the Woods (and the film of the same name), features Jack, originally portrayed by Ben Wright, along with several other fairy tale characters. In the second half of the musical, the giant's wife climbs down a second beanstalk to exact revenge for her husband's death, furious at Jack's betrayal of her hospitality. She is eventually killed as well. Bart Simpson plays the role of the main character in a Simpsons video game ``The Simpsons: Bart& the Beanstalk''. ABC's Once Upon a Time debuts their spin on the tale in the episode ``Tiny'' of season two, where Jack, now a female named Jacqueline (known as Jack) is played by Cassidy Freeman and the giant named Anton is played by Jorge Garcia. In this adaptation, Jack is portrayed as a villainous character. The story was adapted in 2012 by software maker Net Entertainment and made into a slot machine game. Mark Knopfler sang a song, ``After the Beanstalk'', in his 2012 album Privateering. Snips, Snails, and Dragon Tails, an Order of the Stick print book, contains an adaptation in the Sticktales section. Elan is Jack, Roy is the giant, Belkar is the golden goose, and Vaarsuvius is the wizard who sells the beans. Haley also appears as an agent sent to steal the golden goose, and Durkin as a dwarf neighbor with the comic's stereotypical fear of tall plants. In the Season 3 premiere episode of Barney and Friends titled ``Shawn and the Beanstalk'', Barney the Dinosaur and the gang tell their version of Jack and the Beanstalk which was all told in rhyme. In the animated movie Puss in Boots, the classic theme appears again. The magic beans play a central role in that movie, culminating in the scene, in which Puss, Kitty and Humpty ride a magic beanstalk to find the giant's castle. In a Happy Tree Friends episode called ``Dunce Upon a Time'', there was a strong resemblance as Giggles played a Jack-like role and Lumpy played a giant-like role. The story appears in the 2017 commercial for the British breakfast cereal Weetabix, where the giant is scared off by an English boy who has had a bowl of Weetabix.

Contents (hide) 1 Career 2 Acclaim and legacy 3 Personal life 4 References 5 Further reading Career (edit) After graduation, Sabeer briefly worked for Apple Computer (as a hardware engineer) and Firepower Systems Inc. He, along with his colleague Jack Smith, set up Hotmail on 4 July 1996, American Independence Day, symbolizing ``freedom'' from ISP-basede-mail and the ability to access a user's inbox from anywhere in the world As President and CEO, Bhatia led Hotmail until its eventual acquisition by Microsoft in 1998. Bhatia worked at Microsoft for one year after the Hotmail acquisition and in April 1999, left Microsoft to start another venture, Arzoo Inc, ane-commerce firm. In July 2011 Hotmail had 360 million registered users, less than Google's Gmail service. Bhatia started a free messaging service called JaxtrSMS. He said that JaxtrSMS would do to SMS what Hotmail did fore-mail. Claiming it to be a disruptive technology, he says that the operators will lose revenue on the reduction in number of SMSes on their network but will benefit from the data plan that the user has to buy. To date, JaxtrSMS service has failed to replicate the success of Hotmail. Recently, he invested in email collaboration software, ccZen.

She is the beautiful daughter of the exiled Duke Senior and niece to his usurping brother Duke Frederick. Her father is banished from the kingdom which breaks her heart. She then meets Orlando, one of her father's friends 'son and falls in love with him. After angering her uncle, she leaves his court for exile in the Forest of Arden. Disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, Rosalind lives with her sweet and devoted cousin, Celia (who is disguised as Ganymede's sister, Aliena), and Duke Frederick's fool Touchstone. Eventually, Rosalind is reunited with her father and married to her faithful lover, Orlando. Rosalind is one of Shakespeare's most recognized heroines. Admired for her intelligence, quick wit, and beauty, Rosalind is a vital character in ``As You Like It.'' Most commonly seen next to her beloved cousin Celia, Rosalind is also a faithful friend, leader, and schemer. She stays true to her family and friends throughout the entire story, no matter how dangerous the consequences. Rosalind dominates the stage. Her true decision-making skills can be seen in the last scene of Act V (5) where she has to present herself as Rosalind to her father and to Orlando, but at the same time change Phebe's opinion to marry Silvius. She is the main character of the play who extracts the clarity of important traits in other characters. Art and stage depictions (edit) Rosalind has been played by various notable actresses including Elizabeth Bergner in a 1936 film opposite Laurence Olivier as Orlando, Vanessa Redgrave rose to fame playing the part in 1960 with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Helena Bonham Carter in the 2000 BBC Radio 4 version, Helen Mirren in the 1978 BBC version of the play directed by Basil Coleman, and Bryce Dallas Howard in the 2006 production directed by Kenneth Branagh. American actress Patti LuPone played the role at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, after her award-winning portrayal of Eva Peron in the original Broadway run of Evita. This caused much speculation because LuPone was leaving the Broadway stage and moving to ``regional'' work. Adrian Lester won a Time Out Award for his performance as Rosalind in Cheek by Jowl's 1991 production of As You Like It. A male actor in the role (as would have been the norm in Shakespeare's time) underlines the confusion of gender roles within the play: at one point, a male actor is playing a woman who is pretending to be a man acting the part of a woman. Source of the name (edit) Rosalynde is the heroine of Lodge's Euphues 'Golden Legacy. 'Faire Rosalind 'had, however, at this time, acquired a fresh poetic fame as the object of Spenser's attachment, celebrated in his Shephearde's Calendar, 1579, and Colin Clouts Come Home Againe, 1595. 'Of all the sweet feminine names compounded from Rosa, that of Rosa-linda seems to be the most elegant, and therefore most befitting that particular character of ideal beauty which the dramatist here assigns to his imaginary princess. Ganymede, the name she assumes in her disguise as a forest youth, is that of 'Jove's own page '(I, iii, 127), the most beautiful of all mortals, son of Tros and Callirrhoe, chosen by Jupiter to be his cup-bearer, and to dwell among the gods as his chosen servant.

Pictures Cinerama Productions United States Pictures Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Release date December 16, 1965 (1965-12-16) Running time 167 minutes Country United States Language English Budget$6.5 million Box office$4.5 million (est. US/ Canada rentals) Battle of the Bulge is a 1965 American widescreen epic war film produced in Spain, directed by Ken Annakin, and starring Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Robert Ryan, Dana Andrews and Charles Bronson. The feature was filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and exhibited in 70 mm Cinerama. Battle of the Bulge had its world premiere on December 16, 1965, the 21st anniversary of the titular battle, at the Pacific Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California. The filmmakers attempted to condense the Ardennes Counteroffensive, a World War II battle that stretched across parts of Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg and lasted nearly a month, into under three hours. They also shot parts of the film on terrain that did not resemble actual battle locations. This left them open to criticism for lack of historical accuracy, but they claimed in the end credits that they had ``re-organized'' the chronological order of events to maximize the dramatic story. Unlike most World War II epics, Battle of the Bulge contains virtually no portrayals of actual senior Allied leaders, civilian or military. This is presumably because of controversies surrounding the battle, both during the war and after. Though Allied forces ultimately won the battle, the initial German counteroffensive caught them by surprise and caused many casualties. Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Historical inaccuracies 4 Production 5 Reaction 6 Later releases 7 Comic book adaption 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Plot (edit) It is December, 1944. Military Intelligence officer and former policeman Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley (Fonda) and his pilot, Joe (Robert Woods), are flying a reconnaissance mission over the Ardennes forest. Spotting a German staff car the plane buzzes the car and photographs the officer. Alarmed, the chauffeur flees the car, leaving the engine running. ``Petrol is blood,'' rebukes the German officer, marking a theme of the film, the German shortage of fuel. In a subterranean lair, it is revealed the officer is Col. Martin Hessler (Shaw), a fictional Panzer tank commander loosely based on SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Jochen Peiper. Hessler is briefed by his superior, Gen. Kohler (Werner Peters), on a new German attack, piercing west against the American lines. Kohler points out a clock with a 50-hour countdown, which is the time allotted for the operation, beyond which Germany has no resources for full-scale attack. At the same time German soldiers disguised as American troops, led by Lt. Schumacher (Ty Hardin), are tasked with seizing vital bridges and sowing confusion behind the Allied lines. Meanwhile, Kiley returns to headquarters where he warns that the Germans are planning one more all-out offensive. His superiors, Gen. Grey (Robert Ryan) and Col. Pritchard (Dana Andrews), dismiss it out of hand: all available intelligence points to Germany not having the resources and manpower to launch another attack. Hessler, having become concerned about the abilities of his tank commanders after his orderly, Conrad, (Hans Christian Blech) points out the staggering losses Germany has sustained since the war began, reviews them, discovering they are all young and lacking in experience. Overhearing his criticism, the commanders break into a chorus of Panzerlied, restoring Hessler's faith. Hoping to uncover more proof, Kiley visits a US infantry position on the Siegfried Line under command of Maj. Wolenski (Charles Bronson). A patrol led by Lt. Weaver (James MacArthur) and Sgt. Duquesne (George Montgomery) capture some young and obviously inexperienced German soldiers. Kiley concludes that experienced German troops have been replaced by these men and withdrawn for an offensive, but Pritchard dismisses this as well, rebuking Kiley for ``crackpot hunches'' and determining to relieve him of duty. Hessler launches his attack the next day. Awakened by the noise of German tanks, Wolenski leads his men into the wooded area of the Schnee Eifel, where they try to fight them off but are overrun. A group of Allied tanks led by Sgt. Guffy (Telly Savalas) also attempts to slow the Panzers, but their tanks 'weak guns and thin armor make them ineffective, forcing him and his crew to retreat. Lt. Schumacher and his disguised troops capture the only bridge over the Our River capable of carrying heavy tanks. Hessler continues his spearhead toward Ambleve, while being observed by Kiley, who also discovers that a German truck is carrying empty fuel drums. Schumacher later takes control of a vital intersection of three roads connecting Ambleve, Malmedy and the Siegfried Line. He sabotages the road signs, and the rear echelon of Wolenski's troops take the wrong road to Malmedy; almost the entire unit is captured and massacred. Lt. Weaver manages to escape, but Duquesne is killed. US soldiers become suspicious when they witness Schumacher's ``military police'' lay explosives incorrectly on the Our bridge, and his masquerade is revealed, though too late to stop Hessler. When Kohler orders Hessler to bypass Ambleve, Hessler replies that the Americans have no concept of defeat, citing that they will ship things as trivial as a fresh chocolate cake to their front-line troops. He feels he can break their will to fight, and Kohler gives him the night to do so. Hessler's tanks and infantry storm Ambleve, finally taking the town. Although many Americans, including Wolenski, are captured, Grey, Pritchard, Kiley and others escape to the River Meuse. American forces regroup and begin to reorganize for a counterattack. Facing the dangers of a foggy night, Col. Kiley conducts an aerial reconnaissance in an attempt to locate the main German spearhead. He orders the pilot to shut off the engine and glide in an attempt to listen for enemy tanks. Suddenly, through a gap in the fog, he spots Hessler's tank column heading toward American lines. Kiley radios in the coordinates, but his plane is hit by German fire and crashes near an American fuel depot. In Hessler's command vehicle, Conrad finally confronts the Colonel about his warmongering ways after Hessler boasts about the war going on forever, meaning Conrad's sons will have to become soldiers and fight. Hessler is unmoved, transferring Conrad to the fuel battalion. Meanwhile, Gen. Grey's forces, with the Meuse at their back, prepare to fight off Hessler. The outgunned, outarmored American tanks are systematically destroyed, but at the cost of the Germans burning up much of their fuel. Guffy encounters Weaver, who has taken command of a small force of wounded men, and the surviving Americans head to the depot, the same one where the wounded Kiley is recovering. Aware of the German fuel shortages, Hessler leads a detachment toward the depot to capture its stocks, Conrad watching him go. Weaver and the stragglers arrive first. Weaver recognizes Lt. Schumacher, who is still posing as an American MP and whose men have taken control of the depot, but Schumacher doesn't recognize him. At Weaver's signal, he and his men open fire on the disguised Germans, killing them all. As Hessler's column approaches, the US defenders flood the road with gasoline and set it ablaze. The young German crews abandon their machines in terror, only to be shot by the Americans or consumed by the flames. Abandoned by his crew, Hessler goes it alone, only for his tank to be destroyed by a burning fuel drum. General Gray arrives in time to see the Panzers explode. Out of fuel, the remaining Germans give up the attack, marching back to Germany. Conrad, bringing up the rear, discards his rifle and cartridge belt, and confidently marches on, his personal war over. Cast (edit) Henry Fonda as Lt. Col. Daniel Kiley Robert Shaw as Col.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The final tank battle is a rough depiction of the Battle of Celles on December 26, 1944, where the U.S. 2nd Armored Div. smashed the German 2nd Panzer Division. The film creates the false impression that large numbers of American tanks sacrificed themselves against the heavy Tiger IIs and in the process lured the enemy off course, which caused them to run out of gas. In reality, they were already stranded. The tanks used, despite the claims of the producer in an interview, which is one of the DVD extras, are not historically accurate. Although the M24 Chaffee light tanks used in the scene were World War II-era vehicles, they were not in use in the scale shown in the film and were relatively rare. The US M47 Pattons as representing German King Tiger tanks and the M4 Shermans, as represented by the M24 Chaffees, contributed much to the myth or 'meme 'of the 'superior size and firepower which US armor had to contend with. 'However, in World War II, that was actually the task and work of the (mobile) artillery. Aside from the initial American encounters with the German offensive is the absence of cold weather and snow, which were the conditions in which the real battle was fought. There is no trace of snow at all in the film's major tank battle scene, and some battle scenes were fought in flat and bare territory, unlike the mountainous, forested and grassy nature of the Ardennes. The film was shot on location in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range and Madrid, Spain. The sequence with Lt. Schumacher and his men was based on Operation Greif, the plan to parachute English-speaking Germans using American equipment behind American lines to sow confusion and capture the bridges. Absent from this movie is the response by General Patton, whose Third Army relieved the siege of Bastogne. Also, there are no African-Americans in the movie even though the 761st Tank Battalion (The Black Panthers) played a role in Patton's Third Army. Indeed, there is no reference to British forces in the area, but British troops were largely kept behind the Meuse River and thus almost entirely out of the fighting. Also not mentioned is General Eisenhower's decision to split the Bulge front in two, ceding temporary command of two American armies to Field Marshal Montgomery in the northern half of the Bulge; the film implies a totally American operation. There is also no mention of the role of Allied air power hitting the Germans hard at the first sign of clear weather. The film's opening narration, by William Conrad, mentions both Montgomery and Patton but is inaccurate: ``to the north, stood Montgomery's Eighth Army. To the south, Patton's Third Army.'' In fact, Montgomery's northern command was actually the 21st Army Group. The Eighth Army, Montgomery's previous command, was actually in Italy at the time of the Battle of the Bulge. Although Patton was actually in charge of Third Army during the battle, it was part of a much larger American force in the south and was one of four American armies of the 12th Army Group under General Omar Bradley. The film recaptures the major aspects of the battle, depicting how the inexperienced replacement American units stationed in the Ardennes were initially overwhelmed and how confused the situation became. It points out the superiority of heavy German tanks and their major weakness, a lack of fuel. Some early scenes, showing discussions among German officers, accurately depict the Third Reich's desperation to cut American-British supply lines to neutralize the Allies 'huge logistical advantage. Production (edit) Screenwriter Bernard Gordon claims to have rewritten John Melson's original screenplay. Some of the original choices for director were Richard Fleischer, who turned it down and Edward Dmytryk, with whom Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros. refused to work. Technical advisor on the film was Maj. Gen. (then Col.) Meinrad von Lauchert, who commanded the German tank division that made the most headway in the actual battle. For an economical price and with no restrictions, the Spanish army provided an estimated 500 fully equipped soldiers and 75 tanks and vehicles, some of World War II vintage. Reaction (edit) Eisenhower came out of retirement and held a press conference to denounce the film for what he considered its gross historical inaccuracy. The film was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1966. Later releases (edit) The original VHS release of the film for home video use was heavily edited to fit on one VHS tape and used a full screen ``pan and scan'' technique often employed in network telecasts of widescreen motion pictures. The 1992 Laserdisc and 2005 DVD releases run at their full length and are presented letterboxed in the original 2.76: 1 aspect ratio. A Blu-ray release followed in 2007, also in the original 2.76: 1 aspect ratio.

He is known for his television roles as Zack Morris in Saved by the Bell, Detective John Clark in NYPD Blue, and Peter Bash in Franklin& Bash. He was the lead in the 1998 film Dead Man on Campus, and starred in the 2016 TV series Pitch. Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 3 Personal life 4 Filmography 4.1 Film 4.2 Television 5 Awards and nominations 6 References 7 External links Early life (edit) Gosselaar was born in Panorama City, California, the son of Paula (van den Brink), a homemaker and hostess for KLM, and Hans Gosselaar, a plant supervisor for Anheuser-Busch. His Dutch father is of German and Dutch Jewish descent. Gosselaar's Jewish paternal great-grandparents, Hertog and Hester Gosselaar, were killed at the Sobibor extermination camp during the Holocaust. His mother, who is of Indonesian and Dutch descent, is from Bali, Indonesia. At one point, Gosselaar was fluent in Dutch (his older siblings were born in the Netherlands). Gosselaar's parents later separated. Gosselaar's mother worked as his manager. He began modeling at the age of 5. As a child, he appeared in commercials for Oreo cookies and Smurf merchandise, and later won guest spots on television series. He spent his teenage years in the Santa Clarita Valley in Southern California, where he attended Hart High School. Career (edit) Gosselaar first came to public notice as the star of the hit television comedy series Saved by the Bell, in which he played Zack Morris, and which aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993. His character was adapted from the short-lived Disney Channel sitcom Good Morning, Miss Bliss; although that show was cancelled after one season, NBC executives believed that a similar show, with Zack Morris as the series lead, had potential for success. He reprised the role in two TV movies and a less-successful spin-off, Saved by the Bell: The College Years. In 1994, he appeared as Zack Morris in a second spin-off series Saved by the Bell: The New Class in the episode ``Goodbye, Bayside--Part 2'', along with Mario L\u00f3pez as A.C. Slater and Lark Voorhies as Lisa Turtle. In 1996, he appeared in the TV-film She Cried No as a college student who date-rapes his best friend's sister at a fraternity party. In 1998, he starred in the feature film, Dead Man on Campus. Later that same year, Gosselaar played the central character in the TV drama Hyperion Bay, which lasted 17 episodes. In 2001, he starred in the movie The Princess and the Marine, with Marisol Nichols. He also starred in the short-lived WB series D.C. From 2001-05, he played Detective John Clark on ABC's NYPD Blue.

It also peaked at No. 12 in both Canada and New Zealand. In the U.S., where it is one of Lowe's most well-known works, it remains his only single to hit the top 40, whereas in the UK ``I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass'' remains his biggest hit after reaching No. 7 a year earlier. Contents (hide) 1 Background 2 Release history 3 Music video 4 Cultural reference 5 Chart performance 5.1 Weekly charts 5.2 Year-end charts 6 Covers 7 References 8 External links Background (edit) ``Cruel to Be Kind'' was originally written by Nick Lowe and Ian Gomm while in Brinsley Schwarz, having been recorded as a demo during this period. Lowe stated, ``I wrote that when I was with a band, Brinsley Schwarz, that I was with from the early '70s to about the mid-'70s... We recorded it on a demo, it never came out, and when I signed to Columbia Records the A& R man there at the time suggested I record it again. And I didn't think it would do anything, but he kind of bullied me into it.'' Musically, the song was originally closer to a soul style. Lowe later said, ``I originally wrote that to sound a bit like Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, it was more of a soul thing.'' Release history (edit) The song was originally written and recorded for the last Brinsley Schwarz album It's All Over Now, which was never officially released. It next appeared as anon-album B-side on the single ``Little Hitler'' off Nick Lowe's first solo album Jesus of Cool (retitled Pure Pop for Now People in the U.S.). This is now known as the ``original'' version, as compiled on Lowe's 1999 Box Set The Doings: The Solo Years, as well as a bootleg based on the unreleased ``It's All Over Now'', of the same title. (Not to confused with the ``Jesus of Cool'' version). It was finally released on Nick Lowe's first solo album Jesus of Cool (1978) but was thenre-recorded with Rockpile and appeared on Lowe's second (1979) album Labour of Lust, where it became a UK top 10 hit. It was released on the Radar Records label in the UK and Columbia Records in the United States. The single was backed with thenon-album Lowe solo song ``Endless Grey Ribbon'' which Lowe had originally composed for fellow Rockpile member Dave Edmunds, as seen in the ITV documentary ``Born Fighters''. Lowe included the Labour of Lust version of the song on the 1984 12'' single of ``Half a Boy and Half a Man'' off his album Nick Lowe and his Cowboy Outfit, as well as the EP version of his single ``All Men are Liars'' from 1990's Party of One. It also appears on the 2010 ``soundtrack'' album ``inspired'' by the 2006 motion picture The Ant Bully. Live versions of the song appear on Lowe's 1998 EP ``You Inspire Me'', off his Dig My Mood album, and on the 2004 live album Untouched Takeaway. There-recorded, Labour of Lust, version of the song has been included in many compilations of Nick Lowe's work, including 1985's 16 All Time Lowes, 1990's Basher: The Best of Nick Lowe, 1999's The Doings: The Solo Years, 2002's Anthology and 2009's Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe. It has also been included on many various artists compilations of hits of the 70s, such as Poptopia! 70's Power Pop Classics. Music video (edit) This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The video to the song was one of the first music videos aired on MTV, and is a combination of actual footage of Lowe's wedding to Carlene Carter, as well as a humorousre-enactment of the wedding, featuring Carter as herself, Dave Edmunds as their limo driver, Terry Williams as the photographer, Billy Bremner as the baker, and Jake Riviera (Nick's manager at the time) as the best man. The wedding took place on August 18, 1979, at the Tropicana Motel in West Hollywood. All family stayed there for the wedding and reception (also featured in the video). Filming for the video took so long that Lowe was actually late to the wedding. Cultural reference (edit) The song was featured in the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You, where it was sung by alternative rock band Letters to Cleo in the prom scene. Chart performance (edit) Weekly charts (edit) Chart (1979--80) Peak position Australia 12 Canada RPM 12 New Zealand 12 UK 12 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 12 U.S. Cash Box Top 100 12 Year-end charts (edit) Chart (1979--80) Rank Canada 90 U.S. Cash Box 93 Covers (edit) The track has been covered by many artists, notably includingco-writer Ian Gomm, first on his own 1997 album Crazy for You, then again in 2005 for the various artists tribute album Lowe Profile: A Tribute to Nick Lowe. Japanese-and Greek-language versions have been released by various artists, as well as both instrumental versions and dance remixes. A Wilco iTunes-only release in January 2012 features Lowe on vocals with the band backing (they were touring together at the time). The original recording was played during the end credits for the documentary I.O.U.S.A.. Freedy Johnston often performs the song in concert, accompanied by solo ukulele.

No doubt all of these songs owe their inspiration, directly or indirectly, to Shakespeare's Hamlet (Act III, scene 4), in which Hamlet tells his mother, ``I must be cruel only to be kind.''

Released in June 1991, ``Treaty'' peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart in September. ``Treaty'' was the first song by a predominately-Aboriginal band to chart in Australia and was the first song in any Aboriginal Australian language (Yolngu-Matha) to gain extensive international recognition, peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play singles charts. In May 2001 ``Treaty'' was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2009 'Treaty 'was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Contents (hide) 1 Background 2 Musical style 3 Videos 4 Track listing 4.1 Yothu Yindi original version 4.2 Yothu Yindi (Filthy Lucre remix version) 5 Personnel 6 Charts 7 References 8 External links Background (edit) In 1988, as part of Bicentennial celebrations, Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga festival where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja. Hawke responded to the Barunga Statement with a promise that a treaty would be concluded with Indigenous Australians by 1990. In 1991, Yothu Yindi were Hughie Benjamin on drums, Sophie Garrkali and Julie Gungunbuy as dancers, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar, Witiyana Marika on manikay (traditional vocals), bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on yidaki (didgeridoo), Gurrumul Yunupingu on keyboards, guitar and percussion, Makuma Yunupingu on yidaki, vocals, bilma, Mandawuy Yunupingu on vocals and guitar, Mangatjay Yunupingu as a dancer. Mandawuy Yunupingu, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. Mandawuy Yunupingu recalls: Bob Hawke visited the Territory. He went to this gathering in Barunga. And this is where he made a statement that there shall be a treaty between black and white Australia. Sitting around the camp fire, trying to work out a chord to the guitar, and around that camp fire, I said, ``Well, I heard it on the radio. And I saw it on the television.'' That should be a catchphrase. And that's where 'Treaty 'was born.--Mandawuy Yunupingu, 8 July 2004 ``Treaty'' was written by Australian musician Paul Kelly and Yothu Yindi members Mandawuy Yunupingu, Kellaway, Williams, Gurrumul Yunupingu, Mununggurr and Marika and Peter Garrett. The initial release received limited radio and television exposure (mainly on ABC radio and SBS television) and failed to chart. Melbourne-based DJ Gavin Campbell (Razor Records) having heard Treaty, approached Mushroom Records to create a dance-orientated remix. The Filthy Lucre (Paul Main, Gavin Campbell and Robert Goodge)) remix was produced without the band's involvement but with the understanding that the 'Yolngu 'side of the music was preserved. The remix not only modified the musical backing but dispensed with the majority of the English language lyrics, with the song sung almost entirely in the Aboriginal language, Gumatj. The Filthy Lucre remix, was released in June, entering the charts in July and peaking at No. 11 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts by September, spending a total of 22 weeks in the national charts. Success for the single was transferred to the related album Tribal Voice which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The album produced by Mark Moffatt for Mushroom Records was released in September 1991. Mandawuy Yunupingu took leave of absence from his duties as principal to tour and promote the single and album. Other singles from the album were are-released ``Dj\u00e4pana (Sunset Dreaming)'' which peaked at# 13 in 1992 and ``Tribal Voice'' which didn't reach the Top 50. At the 1992 ARIA Awards Yothu Yindi won awards for 'Engineer of the Year 'for ``Maralitja'' (maralitja is Yolngu matha for crocodile man-one of Mandawuy Yunupingu's tribal names), ``Dharpa'' (dharpa is tree), ``Treaty'', ``Treaty (Filthy Lucre remix)'' and ``Tribal Voice'' by David Price, Ted Howard, Greg Henderson and Simon Polinski; 'Song of the Year 'for ``Treaty''; and 'Single of the Year 'for ``Treaty''. Both ``Treaty'' in 1992 and ``Dj\u00e4pana (Sunset Dreaming)'' in 1993 charted on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play singles charts, with ``Treaty'' peaking at# 6. In May 2001 ``Treaty'' was selected by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Musical style (edit) Musically the song is a mixture of Yolgnu and Balanda ways. The timbres of the song include the Balanda rock ensemble of electric guitars, keyboard and drumkit, and on occasion Balanda voices. The Yolgnu sounds include the lead singer's vocal quality, and the traditional instruments, bilma (ironwood clapsticks) and yidaki (didgeridoo). The song's text is partly in English and partly in Yolgnu Matha, and the form of the song, while conforming to the Balanda rock structure of verses and choruses with an 'instrumental 'break, and the process of intensity through repetition of short motives, is nevertherless that of a djatpangarri, a form of Yolgnu popular music. Videos (edit) There were two video clips for ``Treaty''. The first features footage of the 1988 Barunga Festival where the Barunga Statement is shown in its final stages of preparation, and Prime Minister Hawke is shown participating didjeridu-playing and spear-throwing competitions. As the Barunga Statement is presented to the Prime Minister, he is accompanied by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Gerry Hand. Also included in this first clip are images of the band in concert, and footage from the Gove Peninsula of industrial bauxite mining, ceremonial dancing led by Witiyana in the bush and children dancing on the beach. According to the director, Stephen Johnson, it was never his intention to make a consciously 'political 'video. A second clip for ``Treaty'' was made to accompany the Filthy Lucre remix. It was also directed by Stephen Johnson and dispenses with the overtly political shots of the previous video. The video features images of the band in concert as well as footage from the Gove Peninsula of ceremonial dancing led by Witiyana in the bush, Witiyana and Milkayngu dancing with their instruments on the beach, Mandawuy Yunupingu singing over a blazing fire and children dancing on the beach with portable stereo given to them by Mandawuy Yunupingu. We wanted to portray Yolngu people having a good time... we had the political stuff in the first clip... it is political enough in the sense that it is showing a positive, healthy and strong side of Aboriginal culture-that's the best message of all... I wanted people to dance, pick up on the movements and Yolgnu style of dancing.--Stephen Johnson Track listing (edit) Yothu Yindi original version (edit) ``Treaty'' (Paul Kelly, Mandawuy Yunupingu, Stuart Kellaway, Cal Williams, Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, Milkayngu Mununggurr and Witiyana Marika)--3: 35 ``Yolngu Boy'' (Mandawuy Yunupingu)--4: 14 Yothu Yindi (Filthy Lucre remix version) (edit) ``Treaty'' (Filthy Lucre Remix)--6: 52 ``Treaty'' (Radio Mix)--3: 50 ``Treaty'' (Dub)--7: 30 Personnel (edit) Production details Engineer--David Price, Ted Howard, Greg Henderson, Simon Polinski Producer--Mark Moffatt Remixers--Robert Goodge, Gavin Campbell, Paul Main (Filthy Lucre version) Charts (edit) Chart (1991--92) Peak position Australia (ARIA) 11 Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) 9 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 29 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 33 UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 72 US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) 6 References (edit)^ Jump up to: McFarlane, Ian (1999). ``Encyclopedia entry for 'Yothu Yindi '''.

The first word isb'reishit, or bereishit (\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u202c). The definite article (i.e., the Hebrew equivalent of ``the'') is missing, but implied. The complete word literally means ``in (the) beginning (of)''. The same construction is found elsewhere in the Hebrew bible, usually dealing with the beginning of a reign. The second word is the Hebrew verb bara (\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u202c) (``((he) created/ creating''). It is in the masculine form, so that ``he'' is implied. A peculiarity of this verb is that it is always used with God as its subject, meaning that only God can ``bara''; it is the characteristic verb for God's creative activity in Genesis 1. ``Bara'' is also used in Genesis 2 verses 3 and 4. John Walton claims that the meaning of ``bara'' is not ``create'' in the modern sense, but to differentiate/ separate and to allocate roles--e.g., in the creation of Adam and Eve, God allocates gender roles to ``male and female''. Elohim (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd\u202c) is the generic word for God, whether the God of Israel or the gods of other nations. It is used throughout Genesis 1, and contrasts with the phrase Elohim YHWH, ``God YHWH'', introduced in Genesis 2. Et (\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea\u202c) is a particle used in front of the direct object of a verb; in this case, it indicates that ``the heavens and the earth'' is what is being created. The word ha preceding shamayim (heavens) and aretz (earth) is the definite article, equivalent to the English word ``the''. English translation (edit) The Opening of Genesis Chapter 1 from a 1620--21 King James Bible in black letter type. The first edition of the KJV was 1611. Genesis 1: 1--2 can be translated into English in at least three ways: As a statement that the cosmos had an absolute beginning (In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth). As a statement describing the condition of the world when God began creating (When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless). Taking all of Genesis 1: 2 as background information (When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth being untamed and shapeless, God said, Let there be light!). The idea that God created the universe out of nothing (creatio ex nihilo) has become central to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, but it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible, and is not the preferred option. The Priestly authors of Genesis 1, writing around 500--400 BCE, had been concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with the fixing of destinies. This was still the situation in the early 2nd century CE, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God. By the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ex nihilo had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.

                    "context": "Glasgow Coma scale-wikipedia Glasgow Coma scale Not to be confused with Glasgow Outcome Scale. Glasgow Coma Scale Medical diagnostics MeSH D015600 LOINC 35088-4 (edit on Wikidata) The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable and objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and either 14 (original scale) or 15 (more widely used modified or revised scale). GCS was initially used to assess level of consciousness after head injury, and the scale is now used by first responders, EMS, nurses, and doctors as being applicable to all acute medical and trauma patients. In hospitals it is also used in monitoring chronic patients in intensive care. The scale was published in 1974 by Graham Teasdale and Bryan J. Jennett, professors of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow's Institute of Neurological Sciences at the city's Southern General Hospital. GCS is used as part of several ICU scoring systems, including APACHE II, SAPS II, and SOFA, to assess the status of the central nervous system, as it was designed for. The initial indication for use of the GCS was serial assessments of patients with traumatic brain injury and coma for at least 6 hours in the neurosurgical ICU setting, though it is commonly used throughout hospital departments. A similar scale, the Rancho Los Amigos Scale is used to assess the recovery of traumatic brain injury patients. GCS was updated following a review of the helpfulness and usefulness of the scale from Clinicians. It was decided that several things required updating, like the Eye Response element, meaning that instead of responding to ``Painful Stimuli'' being regarded as a 2, a patient that opens their eyes in response to pressure is now considered a 2 in the Eye Response element. Contents 1 Elements of the scale 1.1 Eye response (E) 1.2 Verbal response (V) 1.3 Motor response (M) 2 Interpretation 3 Revisions 4 Controversy 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Elements of the scale (edit) Glasgow Coma Scale 5 6 Eye Does not open eyes Opens eyes in response to pain Opens eyes in response to voice Opens eyes spontaneously N/ A N/ A Verbal Makes no sounds Makes sounds Words Confused, disoriented Oriented, converses normally N/ A Motor Makes no movements Extension to painful stimuli (decerebrate response) Abnormal flexion to painful stimuli (decorticate response) Flexion/ Withdrawal to painful stimuli Localizes to painful stimuli Obeys commands Note that a motor response in any limb is acceptable. The scale is composed of three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS (the sum) is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Eye response (e) (edit) There are four grades starting with the most severe: No eye opening Eye opening in response to pain stimulus. (a peripheral pain stimulus, such as squeezing the lunula area of the patient's fingernail is more effective than a central stimulus such as a trapezius squeeze, due to a grimacing effect). Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with the awakening of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) Eyes opening spontaneously Verbal response (v) (edit) There are five grades starting with the most severe: No verbal response Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory articulated speech, but no conversational exchange. Speaks words but no sentences.) Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Motor response (M) (edit) There are six grades: No motor response Decerebrate posturing accentuated by pain (extensor response: adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm and extension at elbow, flexion of wrist and fingers, leg extension, plantarflexion of foot) Decorticate posturing accentuated by pain (flexor response: internal rotation of shoulder, flexion of forearm and wrist with clenched fist, leg extension, plantarflexion of foot) Withdrawal from pain (absence of abnormal posturing; unable to lift hand past chin with supraorbital pain but does pull away when nailbed is pinched) Localizes to pain (purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e.g., brings hand up beyond chin when supraorbital pressure applied) Obeys commands (the patient does simple things as asked) Interpretation (edit) Individual elements as well as the sum of the score are important. Hence, the score is expressed in the form ``GCS 9= E2 V4 M3 at 07: 35''. Generally, brain injury is classified as: Severe, GCS< 8--9 Moderate, GCS 8 or 9--12 (controversial) Minor, GCS\u2265 13. Tracheal intubation and severe facial/ eye swelling or damage make it impossible to test the verbal and eye responses. In these circumstances, the score is given as 1 with a modifier attached (e.g. ``E1c'', where ``c''= closed, or ``V1t'' where t= tube). Often the 1 is left out, so the scale reads Ec or Vt. A composite might be ``GCS 5tc''. This would mean, for example, eyes closed because of swelling= 1, intubated= 1, leaving a motor score of 3 for ``abnormal flexion''. The GCS has limited applicability to children, especially below the age of 36 months (where the verbal performance of even a healthy child would be expected to be poor). Consequently, the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale was developed for assessing younger children. Revisions (edit) Glasgow Coma Scale: While the 15-point scale is the predominant one in use, this is in fact a modification and is more correctly referred to as the Modified Glasgow Coma Scale. The original scale was a 14-point scale, omitting the category of ``abnormal flexion''. Some centres still use this older scale, but most (including the Glasgow unit where the original work was done) have adopted the modified one. The Rappaport Coma/ Near Coma Scale made other changes. Meredith W., Rutledge R, Fakhry SM, EMery S, Kromhout-Schiro S have proposed calculating the verbal score based on the measurable eye and motor responses. The most widespread revision has been the Simplified Motor and Verbal Scales which shorten the respective sections of the GCS without loss of accuracy. The GCS for intubated patients is scored out of 10 as the verbal component falls away Controversy (edit) The GCS has come under pressure from some researchers who take issue with the scale's poorinter-rater reliability and lack of prognostic utility. Although there is no agreed-upon alternative, newer scores such as the Simplified motor scale and FOUR score have also been developed as improvements to the GCS. Although theinter-rater reliability of these newer scores has been slightly higher than that of the GCS, they have not gained consensus as replacements.

The ferry's single route runs 5.2 miles (8.4 km) through New York Harbor between the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island, with ferry boats making the trip in approximately 25 minutes. The ferry operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with boats leaving every 15 to 20 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes at other times. It is the only direct mass-transit connection between the two boroughs. Historically, the Staten Island Ferry has charged a relatively low fare compared to other modes of transit in the area; and since 1997, the route has been fare-free. The Staten Island Ferry is one of several ferry systems in the New York City area, and is operated separately from other systems such as NYC Ferry and NY Waterway. The Staten Island Ferry route terminates at Whitehall Terminal in Lower Manhattan and St. George Terminal in St. George, Staten Island. At Whitehall Street, connections are available to the New York City Subway and several local New York City Bus routes. On the St. George side, there are transfers to the Staten Island Railway and to the St. George Bus Terminal's many bus routes. Passengers on any bus or subway route can exit at Whitehall Street, take the ferry for free, and use their MetroCard farecards for a free transfer to a bus or train at St. George. The same is true for passengers from Staten Island who want to transfer to the subway or bus in Manhattan by riding the Staten Island Ferry. The Staten Island Ferry originated in 1817, when the Richmond Turnpike Company started a steamboat service from Manhattan to Staten Island. Cornelius Vanderbilt bought the Richmond Turnpike Company in 1838, and it was merged with two competitors in 1853. The combined company was in turn sold to the Staten Island Railroad Company in 1864. The Staten Island Ferry was then sold to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1884, and the City of New York assumed control of the ferry in 1905. In the early 20th century, the city and private companies also operated publicly and privately operated ferry routes from Staten Island to Brooklyn. Owing to the growth of vehicular travel, all of the routes from Staten Island to Brooklyn were decommissioned by themid-1960s; but the route to Manhattan was maintained due to its popularity with passengers. By 1967, the Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry was the only commuter ferry within the entire city. A fast ferry route from Staten Island to Midtown Manhattan ran briefly from 1997 to 1998, with proposals to revive the route resurfacing in the 2010s. The Staten Island Ferry has a high commuter ridership due to the lack of transit connections between Staten Island and the other boroughs. With 23.9 million riders in fiscal year 2016, the Staten Island Ferry is the single busiest ferry route in the United States as of 2016, as well as the world's busiest passenger-only ferry system. The ferry is also popular among tourists and visitors, due to the views of the New York Harbor a trip affords; and it has been featured in several films.

Kennedy Predecessors (edit) Before the New York City area was colonized, the indigenous Lenape Native Americans traversed the area's waterways by boat, traveling from Staten Island to present-day Manhattan and New Jersey. The area was then known as Lenapehoking, and the Lenape traveled along nearby waterways such as Arthur Kill, Kill Van Kull, and Raritan Bay. The area would first be colonized as part of Dutch New Netherland in 1624. New Netherland was taken over by the British Province of New York in 1664, and the British province finally became part of the United States in 1776. During the 18th century, the City of New York occupied only the southern tip of Manhattan, and Staten Island was not incorporated within the greater city. At the time, ferry service along New York Harbor between Staten Island and Manhattan was conducted by private individuals in ``periaugers''. These shallow-draft, two-masted sailboats, used for local traffic in New York Harbor, were also used for other transport in the area. Early years (edit) Cornelius Vanderbilt, an entrepreneur from Stapleton, Staten Island, who would become one of the world's richest people, started a ferry service from Staten Island to Manhattan in 1810. Although Cornelius was only 16 years old at the time, he had sailed extensively enough in his father's periauger that he could easily navigate the New York Harbor Estuary on his own. He earned$100 for his birthday in May 1810, which he used to purchase a periauger called Swiftsure. Vanderbilt then used the periauger to transport passengers from Staten Island to the Battery at Manhattan's tip. He competed against other boatmen providing service in the harbor, who called him ``Commodore'' because of his youthful eagerness; although the nickname was intended to be jocular, it applied to him for the rest of his life. The War of 1812 meant restricted access to New York Harbor from elsewhere along the East Coast. During the war, Vanderbilt profited from carrying cargo along the Hudson River, and he bought extra boats with these profits. After the war, he transported cargo in the harbor, earning even more money and buying more boats. Around the same time, U.S. Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins secured a charter for the Richmond Turnpike Company as part of his efforts to develop the village of Tompkinsville, which would become Staten Island's first European settlement. The company was incorporated in 1815, and the land comprising Tompkinsville was purchased around this time. The company built a highway across Staten Island; it also received the right to run a ferry to New York. The Richmond Turnpike Company began to operate the first motorized ferry between New York and Staten Island in 1817, Nautilus, which was commanded by Captain John DeForest, the brother-in-law of Cornelius Vanderbilt. This new ferry broke the short monopoly on steamboat operations that had been held by the Fulton Ferry, which had connected Manhattan and Brooklyn since it began operation in 1814. Since the steamboats provided much faster means of transportation across the harbor, Vanderbilt sold all his ships to his father in 1818. He subsequently started working for Thomas Gibbons, a small-steamboat operator, operating steamboat lines for Gibbons in New Jersey before later operating his own lines in New York. When Tompkins died in 1825, the company's stocks were placed in a trust at the Fulton Bank in lower Manhattan. Under an act passed in 1824, the bank was to be incorporated under two conditions: it had to acquire the Richmond Turnpike Company's stock, and it would cease operations in 1844. Vanderbilt, who had grown wealthy in the steamboat business in New York waters, bought control of the Richmond Turnpike Company in 1838. After the company's original charter expired in 1844, Vanderbilt transferred the former company's leases and titles to himself and the company's other chief officer, Oroondates Mauran. This was done in their capacity as private citizens rather than as chief officers. When Mauran died in 1848, his share of the company was purchased by Vanderbilt. By themid-18th century, there were three separate ferry companies offering services between lower Manhattan and the eastern shore of Staten Island. The Tompkins and Staples Ferry, operated by Vice President Tompkins's son Minthorne, ran from a pier at the Tompkinsville end of the highway to Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan. The New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry Company, or ``People's Ferry'', was operated by George Law and ran from Stapleton, Staten Island, to Liberty Street, Manhattan. The third ferry was the Richmond Turnpike Ferry, also the ``Staten Island Ferry''; it originated at Vanderbilt's Landing at Clifton, Staten Island, and terminated in Manhattan. All of these companies merged in 1853, after Vanderbilt, who was focused on business ventures elsewhere, convinced Law and Tompkins to buy out his ferry company for$600,000. Vanderbilt remained a dominant figure in the ferry business until the Civil War in the early 1860s. Hunchback (1852) on the James River in Virginia during the Civil War The combined company, the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company, ran services from Whitehall Street to Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Clifton. It originally ran single-ended boats but eventually expanded its fleet to include double-ended boats. The Staten Island and New York Ferry's vessel Hunchback was built in 1852, becoming the first double-decked boat to operate in the harbor. To accommodate growing ridership, three double-ended boats--Southfield I, Westfield I, and Clifton I--were purchased for the ferry between 1857 and 1861. Westfield and Clifton were purchased by the Union Army in September 1861, almost immediately after they had been delivered. The army also purchased Hunchback and Southfield in December of that year. The Union used the ships to man the blockade against the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Of the four boats, only Hunchback survived; after the war, it was redocumented and bought by someone in Boston; it was abandoned by 1880. Due to the loss of these boats, another three boats--Westfield II, Northfield, and Middletown--were obtained in 1862--1863. A fourth boat, Clifton II, was also built, but it was purchased by the U.S. shortly after completion; the vessel was then redocumented, and by 1868 it had been destroyed. Staten Island Railway era (edit) The Staten Island Railway (SIR) opened in stages in 1860. It was necessary to have a direct connection between the new railroad trains and the infrequent ferries to and from Manhattan, but this turned out to be difficult during the beginning of operation. The ferries serving Vanderbilt's Landing were owned by George Law, who operated a competing ferry service called the New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry. Afterwards, Vanderbilt tried to operate a ferry service between Manhattan and Staten Island that would rival Law's ferry service. Vanderbilt started construction on his plan for a central dock on the island, but he abandoned the scheme after a storm destroyed the timber work. Only the large stone foundation remained; this was still visible in 1900 at low tide. A long franchise battle ensued; and as a result, Vanderbilt sold his ferry service to Law in 1862. Vanderbilt subsequently lost interest in Staten Island's transit operations, and he handed the operations of the ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob Vanderbilt, who was the president of the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law's ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company. The railway assumed the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company's operations in 1865. Westfield disaster, an 1871 wood engraving On July 30, 1871, Westfield II was damaged when its boiler exploded while sitting in its slip at South Ferry in Manhattan. Within days of the disaster, between 45 and 91 had died, and from 78 to 208 listed as injured, although figures varied widely between the Times, Herald, Tribune, and World. Among those injured was Antonio Meucci, an Italian immigrant who was developing the first telephone at the time; he was so poor that his wife sold his lab and telephone prototype to buy$6 worth of medications. Jacob Vanderbilt was arrested for murder, though he escaped conviction. This had an adverse effect on the railroad's finances; and on March 28, 1872, the railway and the ferry went into receivership. On September 17, 1872, the property of the company was sold to George Law in foreclosure, with the exception of the ferryboat Westfield II, which was purchased by Horace Theall. Erastus Wiman, a Canadian entrepreneur, planned to develop Staten Island by adding transit. Wiman had become one of Staten Island's most notable figures since moving to New York in 1867, and he had built an amusement area on the island to help develop it. He incorporated the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company on March 25, 1880; and the incorporation of the company was formalized on April 14, 1880. Two years later, Wiman applied to build a ferry dock in Manhattan in order to serve his new ferry routes. Wiman also proposed combining the six to eight separate ferry operations so as to use just one Staten Island terminal. This became the St. George ferry landing, which opened in March 1886. On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company gained control of the SIR and its boats. A new boat, Southfield II, was delivered that year. The Baltimore& Ohio Railroad (B&O) obtained control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by theB&O in 1885, through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, president of theB&O, leased the Railway Ferry Company to theB&O for 99 years. TheB&O could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Formerly, passengers had to transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries, which went from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan; and the latter was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area. With this acquisition, theB&O could start operating ferries to the Whitehall Street terminal, where there was a direct transfer to an elevated station. Two 225-foot (69 m) steel-hulled ferryboats were built during this time and delivered in 1888. These boats were Erastus Wiman (renamed Castleton in 1894) and Robert Garrett. They were the first boats of the Staten Island Railway Ferry fleet to be powered bymulti-cylinder inclined steam engines, which pumped steam more efficiently than the single-cylinder vertical engines on previous boats. Garrett resigned from his position at theB&O in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost significant amounts of money in the Panic of 1893; and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts. In 1893, theB&O commenced plans to divert some CNJ ferries from Jersey City to Whitehall Street, with the latter ordering Easton and Mauch Chunk ferries for the Whitehall Street service. The boats started running in 1897. As part of a general improvement, theB&O also started building a new ferry terminal at St. George in 1895. In 1899, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) formed a partnership in which they were to buy smaller freight railroad companies. PRR president Alexander Cassatt had devised the plan because he thought that two large freight-shipping companies, Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel, were artificially depressing freight-shipping rates by cajoling smaller companies for rebates. Among the PRR's acquisitions was theB&O, which in turn owned the Staten Island Railway and Ferry. Cassatt started buyingB&O stock in 1899 and owned much of theB&O stock two years later. End of Staten Island Railway era (edit) The South Street Seaport, where the damaged Northfield II sank By the 1900s, Staten Islanders were becoming dissatisfied with the railway-operated ferry service to Manhattan, which they felt was unsafe. The turning point came on June 14, 1901, when the CNJ ferry Mauch Chunk struck theB&O ferryboat Northfield II as the latter was leaving the ferry port at Whitehall, tearing a 10-by-20-foot (3.0 by 6.1 m) hole through the middle of Northfield. Damaged beyond repair, Northfield II sank within ten minutes, ending up near the modern South Street Seaport. The crash claimed few victims: out of 995 passengers aboard, only four or five were killed. The dead were not recovered for several days, and one man's body drifted around the southern tip of Manhattan and across the Hudson River. An investigation into the crash found that Northfield II had sunk because of the extent of the damage rather than because of its 38-year age. Despite this, neither captain was criminally charged, although Mauch Chunk's captain was ``censured'' for speeding as well as for not helping the passengers aboard Northfield. In the meantime, theB&O borrowed the paddle-wheeler John Englis from the Williamsburg Ferry Company. On February 21, 1902, two hundred people held discussions with MacDougal Hawkes, the head of the New York City Department of Docks, to demand that the Whitehall-to-St. George ferry service be improved. In summer 1902, as theB&O fought to retain its ownership of the ferry, Henry Huttleston Rogers demonstrated that his steam-powered yacht was faster than the SIR's vessels, and argued that he should thus be allowed to operate the ferry route. Throughout the rest of the year, Rogers's Standard Oil-affiliated transit venture, which also operated streetcar routes on Staten Island, competed with theB&O for the rights to the ferry. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated; and West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond were suggested as possible locations. TheB&O wanted to offer service to St. George and at least one other terminal, while Rogers wanted to use only the Tompkinsville and West Brighton terminals. The two groups submitted their proposals in November 1902; and by February 1903, the Sinking Fund Commission announced their decision to giveB&O the operating license. This decision proved controversial: Hawkes made a recommendation to Mayor Seth Low on February 21, and dissatisfied Staten Islanders showed up to the commission's meeting on February 25. These residents, voicing their dissent, helped cause the commissioners to reject Hawkes's proposal. Shortly after, the government of New York City announced its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. Instead of offering the franchise to either theB&O or Rogers, the Sinking Fund Commission decided, in March 1903, that the city could run two ferry routes from Staten Island. One route would travel to Manhattan, terminating at any North River port between 23rd Street and Battery Park, while the other route would go from Staten Island to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The bill authorizing the city to acquire ferry operations was passed by the 126th New York State Legislature, and it was signed into law by Governor Benjamin B. Odell in May 1903. The city would pay$3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including$2 million for five new screw-propelled ships, one named for each of the five boroughs. The city began soliciting tenders for ferryboats, ultimately deciding to pay$1.7 million for four of the five boats from the Maryland Steel Company. The contract was signed on June 20, 1904. The fifth boat, Richmond, was built on Staten Island by the Burlee Dry Dock Company. The ferryboat Castleton at the Whitehall Street terminal From 1902 to 1903, there were debates on where to put the new Whitehall terminal; and Whitehall Street was decided on as the best location. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city's offer of$500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. Although theB&O had been set to give up the Staten Island Ferry franchise in early 1904, the new borough-class ferryboats were not ready by that time. So, theB&O was granted a two-year contract extension, on the condition that the contract could be canceled with 30 days 'notice. In return, the city could purchase theB&O's ownership share in the terminals and the five existing ships fromB&O, namely Westfield II, Middletown, Southfield II, Robert Garrett, and Castleton, for a set price. A new St. George Terminal was built by the city for$2,318,720, replacing the existing terminal. All of the ships except for Richmond were finished by April 1905 and delivered during the late summer and early fall of that year. Richmond was ready by May 20; and as it had been built in Port Richmond, there was no need to transport the boat. On October 25, 1905, the Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals; and the borough ferryboats started their maiden voyages. The next year, the city took ownership of the fiveB&O ships. City ownership and other ferries (edit) The ferry service from St. George to 39th Street, Brooklyn, became city-operated on November 1, 1906, as provided for by the 1903 law transferring ownership of that route to the city. Its Brooklyn terminus was located near the Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad's former 39th Street terminal, but as that railroad had been converted into the West End subway line, the Brooklyn ferry now primarily served industrial interests in Sunset Park. Mayor George McClellan, elected as Low's successor in 1903, and Docks Commissioner Maurice Featherson were initially skeptical of the acquisition; but despite their objections, the Sinking Funds Commission approved the private line's acquisition in 1905. The route started with three ferryboats from the Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn. Three new boats were then commissioned for the 39th Street route. Named Gowanus, Bay Ridge, and Nassau, they were smaller than the borough-class boats. Bay Ridge was the first to arrive, in July 1907, followed by Gowanus in August, and Bay Ridge in September. A second route from St. George to Brooklyn started operating on July 4, 1912. The privately operated Brooklyn& Richmond Ferry Company operated the service to 69th Street in Bay Ridge. New York City started operating a line from Battery Park to Stapleton in May 1909. This service ran every 90 minutes between 4 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily. It was discontinued at the end of 1913, due to low ridership. Staten Islanders protested against the city's discontinuance of the Stapleton ferry, to no avail. Former pier for 69th Street ferry service Mayor McClellan's successor, William Jay Gaynor, was opposed to what he saw as a hasty purchase of the 39th Street line. Upon becoming mayor in 1910, Gaynor communicated to his administration's docks commissioner, Calvin Tompkins, that the operating costs of that route needed to be reduced; in response, Tompkins replaced the superintendent of ferries. Neither of the city's Staten Island ferries showed a profit until 1915, under John Purroy Mitchel's mayoral administration. The city's purchase of the two Staten Island ferry routes was intended to be temporary, until private operators could be found, but it never happened. These were the only two routes the city operated at the time, but the city continued to award privately operated ferry franchises elsewhere. The ferryboat Mayor Gaynor was delivered in 1914, during Mitchel's administration, to boost service on the Whitehall route, although it had originally been intended for the Sunset Park route. It was not as efficient as the borough-class boats (see\u00a7 Former), so it was relegated to supplementary service. Another vessel in the fleet, Castleton, was sold to a private owner in 1915; its classmate, Robert Garrett (renamed Stapleton in 1906) would remain in city ownership until 1922. Mayor Mitchel's successor, John Francis Hylan, was elected in 1917; and he immediately commissioned a series of new boats. The result was President Roosevelt (also known as T.R.), delivered in 1921, and American Legion I, delivered five years later. The names of both boats triggered some controversy--President Roosevelt due to resentment of Theodore Roosevelt, and American Legion I due to the fact that it was named after the American Legion, which was only one of the various veterans 'organizations in existence. At the same time, Hylan also ordered three more boats for the 39th Street route, and he ordered 11 boats for other city-operated routes. This brought the number of boats ordered by Hylan's administration to 16. After Hylan's electoral defeat by Jimmy Walker in 1925, George W. Loft and William Randolph Hearst were respectively renamed to West Brighton and Whitehall II. In April 1926, the white paint scheme of the boats was replaced by a maroon scheme, which was better at hiding the accumulations of grime on the boats 'exteriors. In March 1924, New York City Plant and Structures Commissioner Grover A. Whalen suggested that the infrequent 69th Street service be placed under city administration, a request that ultimately went unfulfilled, as the Brooklyn& Richmond Ferry would continue to operate the route until 1939. However, in June 1924, the route to 39th Street was taken over by New York Bay Ferry. By the end of that summer, the three ferry routes were advertised as the most convenient way to get to Staten Island until a tunnel between Staten Island and Brooklyn could be completed, although the tunnel never was finished because its construction was halted a year later. In the 1930s, the ferry routes to Whitehall Street and 39th Street each received one class of three new boats. The boats in the Dongan Hills class were delivered from 1929 to 1931 for the 39th Street route, and the boats in the Mary Murray class were delivered from 1937 to 1938 for the Whitehall Street route. The classes 'engines and dimensions were similar, but each class's exterior appearance was very different from the other. The Brooklyn& Richmond Ferry Company found it increasingly difficult to maintain its aging fleet, especially with the competition from the 39th Street ferry's new, problem-free ferryboats. This resulted in infrequent service on the Bay Ridge ferry to 69th Street, which lead to a decline in patronage and fare revenues. In February 1939, the United States Department of Commerce ordered the Brooklyn& Richmond Ferry Company to cease all operations after finding that one of its 40-year-old boats was in a severely deteriorated condition. The Bay Ridge operation was subsequently taken over by the Electric Ferries company on March 1, 1939. Electric Ferries, which also operated other routes in the area, bought three secondhand ferryboats from other companies to supplement seven new boats. In 1940, the Brooklyn& Richmond Ferry Company asked the city to stop its municipal operation to 39th Street, so the 69th Street ferry could carry all Staten Island-to-Brooklyn traffic, thus enabling them to lower rates. However, the city refused. The St. George Terminal, reconstructed in 1951 After the end of World War II in 1945, the city wanted to reconstruct St. George Terminal, which would in turn improve ferry service to Whitehall Street. On June 25, 1946, a fire occurred at St. George, killing three people and destroying the slips for the Whitehall ferry route. The only ferry slips that had not been damaged in the fire were those used by the 39th Street ferry. Because the Whitehall route had more ridership, the 39th Street ferry service was suspended so that Whitehall ferries could stop at St. George. The suspension of ferry service was supposed to be temporary; but when service was still suspended after a year had elapsed, merchants at Brooklyn's Bush Terminal, near 39th Street, began petitioning the city to resume service. However, this service was apparently never resumed. The new terminal was completed in June 1951. From 1950 to 1951, the city ordered the construction of three new Merrell-class boats for the Whitehall Street route. These boats differed significantly from their predecessors in that they used 6-cylinder ``Unaflow'' engines, which allowed for a more efficient steam-powered ferryboat compared to the two 2-cylinder compound steam engines of earlier models. With the lowest bid for the three boats coming in at$6.44 million, the Merrell class was more expensive than the Mary Murray class before it, which had cost only$1 million a boat. The Merrell class would quickly become outdated with the introduction of a subsequent class whose diesel engines were even more powerful. Around this time, ferry services in the area were being discontinued and replaced by bridges and tunnels, leading to the eventual demise of the 69th Street ferry. The exception was the direct ferry from Manhattan to Staten Island, which was not expected to see a significant decrease in ridership because it provided the only direct link between the two boroughs. Electric Ferries 'franchise for the Bay Ridge ferry expired on March 31, 1954; and the city contracted the 69th Street ferry's operation to Henry Shanks in order to keep that ferry running. The 69th Street ferry ceased operation in 1964, due to the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge a short distance south of its route. At the time of the 69th Street ferry's discontinuation, it was being used by7,000 passengers daily, who paid five cents each, and8,000 vehicles daily, which were charged 75 cents apiece. Each boat could fit between 500 and 750 passengers but only 42 vehicles, which meant for traffic jams at both of the ferry's slips, due to the boats 'low capacity. However, the route between St. George and Whitehall Streets was kept open, since the bridge's opening was expected to spur an influx of residents to Staten Island, with a potential increase in commute ridership on the ferry to Manhattan. Later History (edit) By 1967, all other ferries in New York City had closed due to competition from automobile traffic, and the St. George to Whitehall route was the only ferry in the city. It remained as such until the 1980s, when other ferry routes were restarted. Off-peak service was reduced in 1967, but two months later that service was restored. However, due to themid-1970s New York City fiscal crisis, night service ended on July 1, 1975, with alternate service being provided by the Fourth Avenue subway. Night service was restored in the 1980s after two boats, comprising the current Austen class, were ordered specifically for night voyages. These boats entered service in 1986. A Staten Island ferryboat in the Upper New York Bay By the late 1980s, ferries had again become a popular mode of transport in the area. In 1991, seventy companies expressed interest in bidding for the rights to operate new ferries across the city. This list of potential bidders was reduced to three companies by 1993. One of these ferries was to be a ferry from Staten Island to midtown Manhattan; this new ferry would travel at top speeds of 35 knots (65 km/ h; 40 mph), as opposed to the existing Whitehall-to-St. George ferry's 15 knots (28 km/ h; 17 mph). New York Fast Ferry was ultimately selected to run a ferry from St. George to East 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan, starting service in January 1997 with about1,650 commuters a day using the service. The Midtown ferry proved successful until the city essentially eliminated the competing Whitehall Street route's fare in July 1997, as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s ``one-city, one-fare'' transfer scheme: Staten Island transit riders could pay a single$1.50 fare with a MetroCard on a Staten Island bus or train and get a free transfer to a Manhattan bus or subway by taking the St. George--Whitehall ferry at no additional cost, with return trips handled similarly. As a result, daily ridership on the$5-per-ticket Midtown ferry decreased to 400 passengers, and New York Fast Ferry was unable to make a profit on the route. New York Fast Ferry went out of business at the end of 1997, at which point NY Waterway took over the route. NY Waterway also failed to break even on the Midtown route, and it was eliminated on July 31, 1998. Immediately after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Staten Island ferryboats were used to evacuate attack victims from the World Trade Center. The line was then temporarily closed for a week, with ferry service restored by September 18. When it reopened, some ferries were diverted to Bay Ridge due to the closures of subways and roads across the East River. This continued into 2002, by which time some2,200 passengers per day were using the ferry, and continued to do so even after the subways and highways were reopened. In 2003, both terminals 'lower levels were closed, and all vehicular traffic on the ferry was banned, due to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Under this act, passengers would have to board and depart from different sections of the ferry; and since the lower levels of each ferry were used for departing, they could not be used for boarding. This made boarding the ferry inconvenient for park-and-ride users at the St. George Terminal. The lower levels of each terminal were reopened in 2017, to reduce passenger crowding on the ships 'upper levels. The St. George Terminal's lower level was opened during morning rush, and the Whitehall Terminal's lower level was opened during middays and the evening rush. In 2002, the city again proposed eliminating night service, with plans to outsource nighttime operations to other ferry companies in the area. However, night and weekend service was increased in 2004 due to growing ridership. Before the 2004 increase in night service, boats only ran once an hour between midnight and 7 a.m. The ferry had not added more trips during nights and weekends, even though Staten Island's population had increased since 1990. Ridership continued to increase; and in November 2006, additional ferries, running every 30 minutes, were provided during the weekend morning hours. In 2015, weekend-morning and late-night frequencies were increased to every thirty minutes. Efforts to revive the Staten Island-to-Midtown ferry persisted; and in 2013, city councilman James Oddo advocated for a revival of fast ferry service to Staten Island as part of his campaign to become that borough's president. After Oddo's election as borough president, he pushed New York City mayor Bill de Blasio to consider a Staten Island fast ferry as part of de Blasio's proposed Citywide Ferry Service (later renamed NYC Ferry). At the time, the new system's only proposed ferry stop on Staten Island was at Stapleton, which was already adequately served by the Whitehall--St. George route. Citywide Ferry Service was not planning to serve transit-deprived South Shore. Later, the citywide ferry's Stapleton route was relegated to an unfunded plan, leaving Staten Island with no stops on the new system. With the opening of NYC Ferry in 2017, politicians and Staten Island residents again advocated bringing more ferry service to Staten Island, including adding one ferry each to Manhattan and Brooklyn, a stop on the South Shore, and extra stops on the Whitehall--St. George ferry. In April 2017, Oddo announced a tentative agreement with NY Waterway to possibly implement a fast route from St. George to Midtown Manhattan in 2018. The ferry would go to West Midtown Ferry Terminal, as opposed to East 34th Street. Unlike NYC Ferry, the Staten Island-to-Midtown route would not receive any per-passenger subsidies from the city. By September 2017, private developers on the South Shore were also negotiating with SeaStreak to run a separate fast ferry route from the South Shore to Lower Manhattan. View of the Manhattan skyline from a Whitehall Street-bound ferry in 2006 Operations (edit) The Staten Island Ferry operates 24/ 7. A new ferry trip begins every 30 minutes most hours of the day and night, with more frequent service during peak times, and takes 25 minutes to complete the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route. The ferry carried 23.9 million passengers in fiscal year 2016. The Staten Island Ferry is administered separately from NYC Ferry. Route (edit) Wikimedia\u00a9 OpenStreetMap A map showing the route of the ferry through Upper New York Bay The ferry to Staten Island departs Manhattan from the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal at South Ferry, at the southernmost tip of Manhattan near the Battery, and follows a single route. On Staten Island, ferryboats to Manhattan depart from the St. George Ferry Terminal on Richmond Terrace, near Richmond County's Borough Hall and Supreme Court. The ferry ride affords views of the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty and thus is a popular destination on Saturday nights, as beer and food items are served at the snack bar. The backdrop of the Staten Island Ferry's route also makes it a popular place for film shoots, and the ferry has been featured in various films, such as Working Girl (1988), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Many other films and TV episodes use the Staten Island Ferry in establishing shots. In the past, ferries were equipped for vehicle transport, and operators charged$3 per automobile. A vehicle ban was approved in 1992, after the Whitehall Terminal was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt without vehicle loading areas. Although the temporary terminals included car loading areas, car boarding was discontinued after the September 11 attacks. There was a plan to reinstate car boarding because of rising tolls on the Verrazano Bridge, but that was seen as infeasible due to the amount of effort needed to screen every car. While the ferries no longer transport motor vehicles, they do transport bicycles. There is a bicycle entrance to the ferry at either terminal. The bike entrance is always on the ground level, so bicyclists can enter the ferry without needing to enter the building. The ground entrance was reserved exclusively for bike riders until September 2017, when lower-level boarding and disembarking was restored for all passengers. Cyclists are subject to screening upon arrival at the ferry terminals and must dismount and walk their bicycles to the waiting area and onto the boat. Bicycles must be stored in the designated bicycle storage area on each boat. Bicycles may be taken on the lowest deck of the ferry without charge. During rush hours, ferries usually run at 15-to-20-minute intervals, increasing to 30 minutes during themid-days and evenings. Ferries run at 30-minute intervals for a few hours during the early morning--usually 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.--and on weekends. Terminals (edit) Whitehall terminal (edit) Main article: Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal The Staten Island Ferry Terminal, located in Lower Manhattan There have been at least two terminals on the site of the current Whitehall Terminal. When the original terminal opened in 1903, its Beaux-Arts design was identical to the Battery Maritime Building, which still exists. In 1919, a fire at the South Ferry elevated station damaged the building. A$3 million renovation of the terminal was announced in 1953, and it opened on July 24, 1956. The old terminal burned down in a fire on September 8, 1991. A new design was announced the next year, and a temporary terminal was opened at the site to accommodate passengers in the meantime. On February 7, 2005, a completely renovated and modernized terminal, designed by architect Frederic Schwartz, was dedicated, along with the new two-acre Peter Minuit Plaza in the Battery. The terminal contains connections to the New York City Subway's South Ferry/ Whitehall Street station complex, as well as to buses and taxis. A ``gateway to the city'', set against the backdrop of Manhattan's greatest buildings on one side and the river on the other, the design was created to imbue the terminal ``with a strong sense of civic presence''. In his remarks at the terminal's dedication, Mayor Michael Bloomberg stated that ``You can walk into this spectacular terminal day or night and feel like you're part of the city... (the terminal) is a continuation of what you feel on the ferry... in a sense you are suspended over the water.'' Described as ``an elegant addition to (the) city's architecture'', the transit hub was described by a Newsday editor as so beautiful that it had become a tourist attraction in its own right. St. George terminal (edit) The St. George Terminal on Staten Island Main article: St. George Terminal\u00a7 Staten Island Ferry A new ferry and rail terminal at St. George's Landing and an extension of the Staten Island Railway north from Vanderbilt's Landing had been proposed in the 1870s by the owners of the railroad (George Law, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Erastus Wiman) to replace the various ferry sites on the north and east shores of Staten Island. St. George was selected due to its being the point where Staten Island is closest to Manhattan, approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) away. The terminal and local neighborhood were renamed ``St. George'' in honor of Law, allegedly as a concession by Wiman in order to build the terminal and connecting tunnel on land owned by Law. The ferry terminal was opened in early 1886. On June 25, 1946, a large fire destroyed both the wooden ferry and rail terminals, killing 3 people and injuring more than 200. Full service was restored in July of that year. A new$21-million facility was built by the city, and opened on June 8, 1951. Plans for a renovation of the terminal were announced in March 1997, and the terminal was renovated in the 2000s, as part of a$300 million renovation of several ferry terminals in the area, including the Whitehall Terminal. As of 2013, St. George's direct rail-sea connection is one of a few left in the United States. Fares (edit) There is no charge to take the ferry. However, riders who want to make a round trip must disembark at each terminal and reenter through the terminal building to comply with Coast Guard regulations regarding vessel capacity. The turnstiles were dismantled when fares were discontinued in 1997, so there is no easy way to count the number of passengers boarding the ferry, although the crew of each boat can estimate the number of passengers aboard the vessel. The state's per-passenger subsidy in 2012 was$4.86, paid for through taxes. This subsidy rose to$5.87 in 2016, before dropping to$5.16 in 2017. By comparison, the city's per-passenger subsidy for NYC Ferry, in 2017, was$6.50, after accounting for the$2.75 per-passenger fare. For most of the 20th century, the ferry was famed as the biggest bargain in New York City, as it charged the same one-nickel, or five-cent, fare as the New York City Subway. In 1882, riders protested against a proposed fare increase to 10 cents per ride, but were unsuccessful in obtaining a fare reduction. The fare-reduction movement resurfaced in 1894, with multiple petitions being submitted to the New-York Sinking Fund Commissioners. However, these petitions were all denied. By 1898, the fare had been reduced back to a nickel. The fare for the ferry remained a nickel when the subway fare was increased to 10 cents in 1948. Despite the ferry's growing operational shortfalls in the 1950s, the five-cent fare remained, regardless of inflation. By 1968, the Citizens Budget Commission was proposing to hike fares to close the subsidy deficit, with Staten Island commuters to pay 20 cents, and others 50 cents, for a one-way trip. In May 1970, then-Mayor John V. Lindsay proposed that the fare be raised to 25 cents, pointing out that the cost for each ride was 50 cents, or ten times what the fare was bringing in. As part of a city budget passed in June of that year, the nickel fare was kept. Due to the city's financial crisis in themid-1970s, Mayor Abraham Beame submitted a proposal to increase the fare in July 1975. On August 4, 1975, the fare was increased to 25 cents for a round trip, collected in one direction only. The fare increase was intended to earn the ferry service an extra$1.35 million in annual revenue. In 1990, the charge for a round trip was increased to 50 cents, provoking a backlash among Staten Islanders, and sparking calls for its complete abolition. In 1993, grievances over the fare partly contributed to Staten Island's passing anon-binding referendum to secede from New York City. Rudy Giuliani's three-percent margin of victory in the concurrent mayoral elections was in considerable part due to the support of 80% of Staten Island voters, whose concerns he had pledged to address. The passenger fare was subsequently eliminated altogether, in July 1997, as part of the implementation of the MTA's ``one-city, one-fare'' system, which allowed for more free transfers between different modes of transit in New York City. The$3 car fares were not affected, as they were separate. The new MetroCard was configured to allow one free transfer between buses and subways; if the rider had paid a fare less than two hours prior, a ferry trip to be regarded as part of that transfer. Eliminating the ferry fare was seen as an action to standardize Staten Islanders 'MetroCard fares with those of commuters in other boroughs. Despite the fact that the ferry fare had netted$6 million in annual revenue for the city, its abolition only cost the city about$1 million. The other$5 million represented the money saved not having to maintain the now-removed turnstiles, as well as the revenue from MetroCard fares. Some riders disliked the fares 'discontinuance, as they felt that free service might mean lower-quality service. In 2014, the city's Independent Budget Office conducted a study investigating the viability of collecting fares from everyone except Staten Island residents. The study found that a$4 fare would garner$35.5 million in fifteen years, while a$2 fare would bring in only$804,000 during the same time. Approximately 4 million passengers would be subject to the fare annually, based on the previous year's ridership figure of 21.9 million. Ridership (edit) Ridership Fiscal Years 2007--2017 Fiscal Year Ridership (millions) Ref. 2007 18.953 2008 19.757 2009 20.118 21.464 2011 21.404 2012 22.178 2013 21.399 2014 21.256 2015 21.9 2016 23.1 2017 23.9 Detailed ridership figures for many fiscal years are not widely available because, in many cases, they not have been publicly released. A 1958 New York Times article cited a figure of 24 million annual riders. Ridership on the ferry peaked in 1964, with 27.5 million passengers, but the figure dropped to 22 million in 1965, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened. In the early 2000s, ridership mostly fluctuated between 18 and 19 million, rising to 21.8 million in 2006 before dropping to 18.5 million the next year. Afterward, ridership started rising again, reaching over 21 million in fiscal year 2011. In fiscal 2012, the ferry carried 22.18 million passengers, the highest figure in several decades. The figure in fiscal 2013 declined slightly to 21.4 million. Ridership for fiscal 2014 declined again to 21.25 million, while ridership on private ferry services increased. Public ridership then began rising in subsequent years, especially after the 2015 increase in trip frequency, when ridership reached 21.9 million. In fiscal 2016, ridership on the ferry increased to 23.1 million passengers; and in fiscal 2017, ridership increased further, to 23.9 million passengers, breaking the previous year's record. The Staten Island Ferry is the single busiest ferry route in the United States as of 2016, as well as the world's busiest passenger-only ferry. Although not the busiest US ferry system overall--that distinction belonging to the multiple-route Washington State Ferries, which carried 24.2 million passengers in 2016--the Staten Island Ferry carried 23.9 million passengers over its single route in fiscal 2017. Fleet (edit) Current (edit) There are eight ferry boats currently in service, from four classes--Kennedy, Barberi, Austen, and Molinari. Kennedy class (edit) The John F. Kennedy class boat of the Staten Island Ferry The ``Kennedy class'' comprises MV John F. Kennedy, MV American Legion II, and MV Governor Herbert H. Lehman, which were built in 1965. Only John F. Kennedy remains in service as of 2017. Each boat had a crew of 15 and could carry3,055 passengers and 40 vehicles. The boats were 297 feet (91 m) long and 69 feet 10 inches (21.29 m) wide, with drafts of 13 feet 6 inches (4.11 m), tonnage of2,109 gross tons, service speed of 16 knots (30 km/ h), and engines capable of6,500 horsepower (4.8 MW). They were built by the Levingston Shipbuilding Company in Orange, Texas. The American Legion II's inspection certificate lapsed in 2006, and it was retired with the acquisition of the Molinari-class ferries. Herbert H. Lehman was retired on June 30, 2007, after the 10: 30 p.m. run from Whitehall Street to St. George. John F. Kennedy is being kept for the time being, as captains considered it to be the most reliable vessel in the fleet, and riders preferred its abundant open-air deck space. Barberi class (edit) Samuel I. Newhouse, one of two Barberi class ferryboats in the fleet, crosses Upper New York Bay The ``Barberi class'' comprises MV Andrew J. Barberi and MV Samuel I. Newhouse, which were built in 1981 and 1982, respectively. Each boat can carry6,000 passengers, but not any cars. The boats are 310 feet (94 m) long and 69 feet 10 inches (21.29 m) wide, with a draft of 13 feet 6 inches (4.11 m), tonnage of3,335 gross tons, service speed of 16 knots (30 km/ h), and engines capable of8,000 horsepower (6.0 MW). The boats are each manned by a crew of 15. The Barberi class was built at the Equitable Shipyard in Florida, at a cost of$16.5 million each. At the time of construction, the ships 'capacity was the largest of any licensed ferry in the world. Andrew J. Barberi was named after the man who coached Curtis High School's football team from the 1950s through the 1970s, while Samuel I. Newhouse was named after the Staten Island Advance's publisher from 1922 to 1979. Austen class (edit) The ``Austen class'' comprises MV Alice Austen and MV John A. Noble, which were built in 1986 and are commonly referred to as ``the Little Boats'' or ``Mini Barberis''. Each boat carries1,280 passengers, but not cars. The boats are 207 feet (63 m) long and 40 feet (12 m) wide, with a draft of 8 feet 6 inches (2.59 m), tonnage of 499 gross tons, service speed of 16 knots (30 km/ h), and engines capable of3,200 horsepower (2.4 MW). Each boat has a crew of nine. Their namesakes are Alice Austen (1866--1952), a Staten Island photographer, and John A. Noble (1913--83), a Staten Island marine artist. Austen-class vessels usually operate late at night and into the early morning, when ridership is lower. Plans call for either the Alice Austen or the John A. Noble to be converted from using low-sulfur diesel as fuel to liquefied natural gas (LNG), in an effort to halve fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent. Molinari class (edit) The passenger space of a Molinari-class ferryboat of the Staten Island Ferry The ``Molinari class'' comprises MV Guy V. Molinari, MV Senator John J. Marchi, and MV Spirit of America. Each boat carries a maximum of4,427 passengers and up to 30 vehicles. The boats are 310 feet (94 m) long by 70 feet (21 m) wide and have drafts of 13 feet 10 inches (4.22 m), tonnage of2,794 gross tons, service speed of 16 knots (30 km/ h), and engines capable of9,000 horsepower (6.7 MW). Built by the Manitowoc Marine Group in Marinette, Wisconsin, they are designed to have a look and ambiance reminiscent of the classic New York ferryboats. The lead boat is named after Guy V. Molinari, a former U.S. Representative for several Staten Island districts, who later became a borough president of Staten Island. It was delivered in September 2004. The second ferry was named for State Senator John Marchi, who represented Staten Island for fifty years. The third ferry, Spirit of America, was to be put into service on October 25, 2005, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the municipal takeover of the Staten Island Ferry from theB&O railroad. Mechanical problems on the Molinari-class ferries and legal proceedings kept Spirit of America sidelined at the Staten Island Ferry's St. George maintenance facility until its maiden voyage on April 4, 2006. Since delivery, the ferries have been beset by frequent breakdowns, with 58 such incidents from 2008 to 2014; almost half of these breakdowns have been on Guy V. Molinari. Future (edit) Main article: Ollis-class ferry Starting in 2019, John F. Kennedy, Samuel I. Newhouse, and Andrew J. Barberi are to be replaced by three new 310 feet (94 m) vessels, named the Ollis class, after US Army Staff Sgt. Michael Ollis of Staten Island, who was killed in action during the War in Afghanistan. Elliott Bay Design devised the plans for the new ferries. As part of the new acquisition, city officials allowed passengers to vote on the types of seats that would be installed in the new fleet. In November 2016, Eastern Shipbuilding was confirmed as the low bidder for constructing the ships, and the shipyard was awarded the contract with a notice to proceed on March 1, 2017. Delivery of the new ships is planned for 2019 and 2020. A petition to name one of the Ollis-class ships after Staten Island firefighter John G. Chipura, who died in the September 11 attacks, had11,000 signatures by September 2017. Former (edit) Several ferry classes, purchased since the city assumed ownership of the ferry, have been retired. The ferries named after the five boroughs, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Richmond, were the first ones commissioned for the city line in 1905. All of the boats except Richmond were 246 feet (75 m) long and 46 feet (14 m) wide, with a draft of 18 feet (5.5 m) and a gross tonnage of1,954. Richmond had the same width and draft as its classmates, but was 232 feet (71 m) long with a gross tonnage of2,006. All of the borough-class boats were retired in the 1940s. Manhattan went out of documentation by 1941, when Bronx was the first of the remaining boats to be scrapped. The three remaining ferries were scrapped by 1947, Brooklyn having served as a floating school for the United States Coast Guard in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, beginning in 1943, and Richmond having been converted to a barge in 1944. The city's next class, delivered two years after the borough-class boats, was Gowanus, Bay Ridge, and Nassau, which were used for the Brooklyn line. Each boat was 182 feet (55 m) long and 45 feet (14 m) wide, with a draft of 16 feet (4.9 m) and a gross tonnage of 862. These boats were all sold by 1940. Bay Ridge was used as the barge Rappahannock River while the other two were scrapped. The third class consisted of Mayor Gaynor (1914), followed by President Roosevelt (1922) and American Legion I (1926). Each boat in the class differed in dimensions and gross tonnage from the others. Mayor Gaynor had a different engine and vastly different dimensions than its other two classmates, so it is sometimes considered as a different class. Mayor Gaynor's 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine was not as efficient as the 2-cylinder compression engines of the previous borough-class boats, so the two vessels following it reverted to the more reliable borough-class engine. Additionally, Mayor Gaynor was 210 feet (64 m) long and 45 feet (14 m) wide, with a draft of 17 feet (5.2 m) and a gross tonnage of1,634. The other two boats were approximately 251 feet (77 m) long by 46 feet (14 m) wide, and had a draft of 17 or 18 feet (5.2 or 5.5 m) and a gross tonnage of2,029 (for President Roosevelt) or2,089 (for American Legion I). Mayor Gaynor was the first to be dismantled, in 1951, while President Roosevelt and American Legion I were scrapped in 1956 and 1963, respectively. In 1923, the steam turbine-powered ferryboats William Randolph Hearst, Rodman Wanamaker, and George W. Loft were built. The names of the boats, which were all derived from those of prominent New York City businessmen, were kept secret until the vessels were unveiled. All of these boats had a length of 205 feet (62 m), a width of 45 feet (14 m), a draft of 16 feet (4.9 m), and a gross tonnage of 875. George W. Loft shared her name with another boat used up the Hudson River, and so the other boat had to be renamed. Used mostly on the 39th Street route, these boats went into service in June 1924 and were out of documentation by 1954. The ferryboat Dongan Hills, pictured in 1945 A subsequent class, delivered from 1929 through 1931, consisted of Dongan Hills, Tompkinsville, and Knickerbocker, in order of delivery. The first two boats had the same dimensions as President Roosevelt, while Knickerbocker was one foot longer and one foot wider, with a gross tonnage of2,045. Tompkinsville and Dongan Hills were out of documentation in 1967--1968, while Knickerbocker was sold for scrap in 1965. The fifth class--the Miss New York class, comprising Miss New York, Gold Star Mother, and Mary Murray--was delivered in 1938. They had the same width, length, and draft as Knickerbocker, with a gross tonnage of2,126. Gold Star Mother was decommissioned in 1969, to save money before being auctioned off in 1974. Gold Star Mother's sister Mary Murray was retired in 1974 and sold at auction. From 1982 through themid-2000s, it then sat as a floating wreck on the Raritan River, within view of the New Jersey Turnpike, and was partially broken up for scrap in 2008. The third sister ship, Miss New York, was decommissioned in 1975 and auctioned. Miss New York was used as a restaurant for a while, but then sank. The most recently fully retired class of ferryboats, Cornelius G. Kolff, Private Joseph F. Merrell, and Verrazzano, went into service in 1951. These boats were slightly larger than their predecessors, with a length of 269 feet (82 m), a width of 69 feet (21 m), a draft of 19 feet (5.8 m), and a gross tonnage of2,285. They were built at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyard on Staten Island. Verrazzano was decommissioned and sold at auction in the 1980s, with proposals to use the old ferry at a Japanese amusement park. The deal fell through, and it became a floating wreck at the Red Hook Container Terminal. Its two classmates, Kolff (later Walter Keane) and Merrell (later Vernon C. Bain, then Harold A. Wildstein) were shipped to Rikers Island in 1987 to deal with prison overcrowding there, to be used as an interim housing solution while new jail facilities were being built. Keane and Wildstein, along with the retired British troop carriers Bibby Resolution and Bibby Venture, were used to house1,000 inmates. The vessels were removed from prison use in 1997, after the Vernon C. Bain floating barge was built; and both vessels were scrapped in 2004. American Legion II, a now-retired Kennedy-class ferry, on its way to Staten Island Most of the Kennedy class, built in 1965, has also been scrapped. American Legion II was retired in 2006 and sold for scrap. Its classmate Governor Herbert H. Lehman was retired in 2007 and sold at auction by the city in 2011. By 2012, it was being scrapped at Steelways Shipyard in Newburgh, New York, where it sank after developing a leak. The third boat in the class, John F. Kennedy, is still in service as of 2017. Incidents (edit) Early 20th century, after city takeover (edit) In November 1910, the ferryboat Nassau ran aground on the seawall of Governors Island, but most passengers were able to jump off the boat safely. The boat only suffered minor damage to its propeller. The ferryboat Mayor Gaynor ran aground near Robbins Reef Light, in the middle of the harbor, on October 31, 1921. This was a result of a heavy fog, which caused other transit accidents that injured a total of 20 people that day. The same boat was involved in another crash, on February 24, 1929, when it ran into the Whitehall ferry slip and injured three people. Coincidentally, Mayor Gaynor collided with the same spot a year and a day later, injuring seven people. Late 20th century (edit) A heavy fog across the East Coast on January 16, 1953, caused four ferry accidents in New York Harbor. One of these accidents was when Gold Star crashed into the United States Lines freighter American Veteran, injuring 13 people. In another heavy fog four days later, Joseph F. Merrill crashed into an Ellis Island ferryboat, jolting several passengers but injuring no one. Five years later, on February 8, 1958, Dongan Hills was hit by the Norwegian tanker Tynefield, injuring 15 people. On November 7, 1978, American Legion II crashed into the concrete seawall near the Statue of Liberty ferry port during a dense fog, injuring 173 people on board. American Legion II was involved in another crash two and a half years later. On May 6, 1981, at 7: 16 am EDT, American Legion II, en route from Staten Island to Manhattan with approximately2,400 passengers aboard, was rammed in dense fog by the M/ V Hoegh Orchid, a Norwegian freighter inbound from the sea to a berth in Brooklyn. The ferryboat was damaged from below the main deck up to the bridge deck; and 71 passengers were treated for injuries, three of whom were hospitalized. The absence of a gyrocompass, which could have supplemented existing radar capabilities in helping the ferry master to avoid collisions, was noted in the February 2, 1982, report by the National Transportation Safety Board. On July 7, 1986, a mentally ill man, Juan Gonzalez, attacked passengers with a sword on Samuel I. Newhouse. He killed two and injured nine before being detained and sent to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation. On April 12, 1995, Andrew J. Barberi rammed her slip at St. George, due to a mechanical malfunction. The doors on the saloon deck were crushed by the adjustable aprons, which a quick-thinking bridgeman lowered to help stop the oncoming ferryboat. Several people were injured. The terminal was also the site of an incident involving a vehicle two years later, on September 19, 1997. A car plunged off John F. Kennedy as she was docking, causing minor injuries to the driver and a deckhand who was knocked overboard. 21st century (edit) Damage to Andrew J. Barberi's interior after the 2003 Staten Island Ferry crash The new century featured the city's deadliest mass-transit incident in 50 years. On October 15, 2003, at 3: 21 pm EDT, Andrew J. Barberi collided with a pier on the eastern end of the St. George ferry terminal, killing eleven people, seriously injuring many others, and tearing a huge slash through the lowest of the three passenger decks. The incident spurred an investigation into safety practices aboard the ferry, as well as an accident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. Andrew J. Barberi's captain at the time of the incident was fired, and Andrew J. Barberi returned to service in 2004. The St. George terminal was also the site of two minor ramming incidents. On July 1, 2009, at 7: 09 pm EDT, John J. Marchi lost power and hit a pier at the St. George Terminal at full speed, resulting in 15 minor injuries. The boat was cited as having a history of electrical problems since being put into service in 2005. A similar incident at the same location occurred on May 8, 2010, at 9: 20 am EDT. As the then-recently-rebuilt Andrew J. Barberi approached the dock, the reverse thrust failed to respond; and the boat could not slow down. Thirty-seven of the 252 passengers on board were injured.

                    "context": "Correlation does not imply causation-wikipedia Correlation does not imply causation Jump to: navigation, search See also: Illusory correlation In statistics, many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated, it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other. That ``correlation proves causation,'' is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ``with this, therefore because of this,'' and ``false cause.'' A similar fallacy, that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is the post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ``after this, therefore because of this.'') fallacy. For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD.Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens. The use of HRT and decreased incidence of coronary heart disease were coincident effects of a common cause (i.e. the benefits associated with a higher socioeconomic status), rather than a direct cause and effect, as had been supposed. As with any logical fallacy, identifying that the reasoning behind an argument is flawed does not imply that the resulting conclusion is false. In the instance above, if the trials had found that hormone replacement therapy does in fact have a negative incidence on the likelihood of coronary heart disease the assumption of causality would have been correct, although the logic behind the assumption would still have been flawed. Indeed, a few go further, using correlation as a basis for testing a hypothesis to try to establish a true causal relationship; examples are the Granger causality test and convergent cross mapping.

This is the meaning intended by statisticians when they say causation is not certain. Indeed, p implies q has the technical meaning of the material conditional: if p then q symbolized as p\u2192 q. That is ``if circumstance p is true, then q follows.'' In this sense, it is always correct to say ``Correlation does not imply causation.'' However, in casual use, the word ``implies'' loosely means suggests rather than requires. The idea that correlation and causation are connected is certainly true; where there is causation, there is a likely correlation. Indeed, correlation is used when inferring causation; the important point is that such inferences are made after correlations are confirmed as real and all causational relationship are systematically explored using large enough data sets. Edward Tufte, in a criticism of the brevity of ``correlation does not imply causation'', deprecates the use of ``is'' to relate correlation and causation (as in ``Correlation is not causation''), citing its inaccuracy as incomplete. While it is not the case that correlation is causation, simply stating their nonequivalence omits information about their relationship. Tufte suggests that the shortest true statement that can be made about causality and correlation is one of the following: ``Empirically observed covariation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality.'' ``Correlation is not causation, but it sure is a hint.'' General pattern (edit) For any two correlated events, A and B, the different possible relationships include: A causes B (direct causation); B causes A (reverse causation); A and B are consequences of a common cause, but do not cause each other; A and B both causes C, which is (explicitly or implicitly) conditioned on. If A and B cause C, why do A and B have to be correlated?; A causes B and B causes A (bidirectional or cyclic causation); A causes C which causes B (indirect causation); There is no connection between A and B; the correlation is a coincidence. Thus there can be no conclusion made regarding the existence or the direction of a cause-and-effect relationship only from the fact that A and B are correlated. Determining whether there is an actual cause-and-effect relationship requires further investigation, even when the relationship between A and B is statistically significant, a large effect size is observed, or a large part of the variance is explained. Examples of illogically inferring causation from correlation (edit) B causes a (reverse causation or reverse causality) (edit) Reverse causation or reverse causality or wrong direction is an informal fallacy of questionable cause where cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa. Example 1 The faster windmills are observed to rotate, the more wind is observed to be. Therefore wind is caused by the rotation of windmills. (Or, simply put: windmills, as their name indicates, are machines used to produce wind.) In this example, the correlation (simultaneity) between windmill activity and wind velocity does not imply that wind is caused by windmills. It is rather the other way around, as suggested by the fact that wind doesn't need windmills to exist, while windmills need wind to rotate. Wind can be observed in places where there are no windmills ornon-rotating windmills--and there are good reasons to believe that wind existed before the invention of windmills. Example 2 When a country's debt rises above 90% of GDP, growth slows. Therefore, high debt causes slow growth. This argument by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff was refuted by Paul Krugman on the basis that they got the causality backwards: in actuality, slow growth causes debt to increase. Example 3 Driving a wheelchair is dangerous, because most people who drive them have had an accident. Example 4 In other cases it may simply be unclear which is the cause and which is the effect. For example: Children that watch a lot of TV are the most violent. Clearly, TV makes children more violent. This could easily be the other way round; that is, violent children like watching more TV than less violent ones. Example 5 A correlation between recreational drug use and psychiatric disorders might be either way around: perhaps the drugs cause the disorders, or perhaps people use drugs to self medicate for preexisting conditions. Gateway drug theory may argue that marijuana usage leads to usage of harder drugs, but hard drug usage may lead to marijuana usage (see also confusion of the inverse). Indeed, in the social sciences where controlled experiments often can not be used to discern the direction of causation, this fallacy can fuel long-standing scientific arguments. One such example can be found in education economics, between the screening/ signaling and human capital models: it could either be that having innate ability enables one to complete an education, or that completing an education builds one's ability. Example 6 A historical example of this is that Europeans in the Middle Ages believed that lice were beneficial to your health, since there would rarely be any lice on sick people. The reasoning was that the people got sick because the lice left. The real reason however is that lice are extremely sensitive to body temperature. A small increase of body temperature, such as in a fever, will make the lice look for another host. The medical thermometer had not yet been invented, so this increase in temperature was rarely noticed. Noticeable symptoms came later, giving the impression that the lice left before the person got sick. In other cases, two phenomena can each be a partial cause of the other; consider poverty and lack of education, or procrastination and poor self-esteem. One making an argument based on these two phenomena must however be careful to avoid the fallacy of circular cause and consequence. Poverty is a cause of lack of education, but it is not the sole cause, and vice versa. Third factor C (the common-causal variable) causes both a and B (edit) Main article: Spurious relationship The third-cause fallacy (also known as ignoring a common cause or questionable cause) is a logical fallacy where a spurious relationship is confused for causation. It asserts that X causes Y when, in reality, X and Y are both caused by Z. It is a variation on the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy and a member of the questionable cause group of fallacies. All of these examples deal with a lurking variable, which is simply a hidden third variable that affects both causes of the correlation. A difficulty often also arises where the third factor, though fundamentally different from A and B, is so closely related to A and/ or B as to be confused with them or very difficult to scientifically disentangle from them (see Example 4). Example 1 Sleeping with one's shoes on is strongly correlated with waking up with a headache. Therefore, sleeping with one's shoes on causes headache. The above example commits the correlation-implies-causation fallacy, as it prematurely concludes that sleeping with one's shoes on causes headache. A more plausible explanation is that both are caused by a third factor, in this case going to bed drunk, which thereby gives rise to a correlation. So the conclusion is false. Example 2 Young children who sleep with the light on are much more likely to develop myopia in later life. Therefore, sleeping with the light on causes myopia. This is a scientific example that resulted from a study at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. Published in the May 13, 1999 issue of Nature, the study received much coverage at the time in the popular press. However, a later study at Ohio State University did not find that infants sleeping with the light on caused the development of myopia. It did find a strong link between parental myopia and the development of child myopia, also noting that myopic parents were more likely to leave a light on in their children's bedroom. In this case, the cause of both conditions is parental myopia, and the above-stated conclusion is false. Example 3 As ice cream sales increase, the rate of drowning deaths increases sharply. Therefore, ice cream consumption causes drowning. This example fails to recognize the importance of time of year and temperature to ice cream sales. Ice cream is sold during the hot summer months at a much greater rate than during colder times, and it is during these hot summer months that people are more likely to engage in activities involving water, such as swimming. The increased drowning deaths are simply caused by more exposure to water-based activities, not ice cream. The stated conclusion is false. Example 4 A hypothetical study shows a relationship between test anxiety scores and shyness scores, with a statistical r value (strength of correlation) of+. 59. Therefore, it may be simply concluded that shyness, in some part, causally influences test anxiety. However, as encountered in many psychological studies, another variable, a ``self-consciousness score'', is discovered that has a sharper correlation (+. 73) with shyness. This suggests a possible ``third variable'' problem, however, when three such closely related measures are found, it further suggests that each may have bidirectional tendencies (see ``bidirectional variable'', above), being a cluster of correlated values each influencing one another to some extent. Therefore, the simple conclusion above may be false. Example 5 Since the 1950s, both the atmospheric CO level and obesity levels have increased sharply. Hence, atmospheric CO causes obesity. Richer populations tend to eat more food and produce more CO. Example 6 HDL (``good'') cholesterol is negatively correlated with incidence of heart attack. Therefore, taking medication to raise HDL decreases the chance of having a heart attack. Further research has called this conclusion into question. Instead, it may be that other underlying factors, like genes, diet and exercise, affect both HDL levels and the likelihood of having a heart attack; it is possible that medicines may affect the directly measurable factor, HDL levels, without affecting the chance of heart attack. Bidirectional causation: a causes B, and B causes a (edit) Causality is not necessarily one-way; in a predator-prey relationship, predator numbers affect prey numbers, but prey numbers, i.e. food supply, also affect predator numbers. The relationship between a and B is coincidental (edit) The two variables aren't related at all, but correlate by chance. The more things are examined, the more likely it is that two unrelated variables will be appear to be related. For example: The result of the last home game by the Washington Redskins prior to the presidential election predicted the outcome of every presidential election from 1936 to 2000 inclusive, despite the fact that the outcomes of football games had nothing to do with the outcome of the popular election. This streak was finally broken in 2004 (or 2012 using an alternative formulation of the original rule). A collection of such coincidences finds that for example, there is a 99.79% correlation for the period 1999-2009 between U.S. spending on science, space, and technology; and the number of suicides by suffocation, strangulation, and hanging. The Mierscheid law, which correlates the Social Democratic Party of Germany's share of the popular vote with the size of crude steel production in Western Germany. Alternating bald--hairy Russian leaders: A bald (or obviously balding) state leader of Russia has succeeded anon-bald (``hairy'') one, and vice versa, for nearly 200 years. Determining causation (edit) In academia (edit) Main articles: Causality and Causality (physics) The nature of causality is systematically investigated in several academic disciplines, including philosophy and physics. In academia, there are a significant number of theories on causality; The Oxford Handbook of Causation (Beebee, Hitchcock& Menzies 2009) encompasses 770 pages. Among the more influential theories within philosophy are Aristotle's Four causes and Al-Ghazali's occasionalism. David Hume argued that beliefs about causality are based on experience, and experience similarly based on the assumption that the future models the past, which in turn can only be based on experience--leading to circular logic. In conclusion, he asserted that causality is not based on actual reasoning: only correlation can actually be perceived. Immanuel Kant, according to Beebee, Hitchcock& Menzies (2009), held that ``a causal principle according to which every event has a cause, or follows according to a causal law, can not be established through induction as a purely empirical claim, since it would then lack strict universality, or necessity''. Outside the field of philosophy, theories of causation can be identified in classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, spacetime theories, biology, social sciences, and law. To establish a correlation as causal within physics, it is normally understood that the cause and the effect must connect through a local mechanism (cf. for instance the concept of impact) or a nonlocal mechanism (cf. the concept of field), in accordance with known laws of nature. From the point of view of thermodynamics, universal properties of causes as compared to effects have been identified through the Second law of thermodynamics, confirming the ancient, medieval and Cartesian view that ``the cause is greater than the effect'' for the particular case of thermodynamic free energy. This, in turn, is challenged by popular interpretations of the concepts of nonlinear systems and the butterfly effect, in which small events cause large effects due to, respectively, unpredictability and an unlikely triggering of large amounts of potential energy. Causality construed from counterfactual states (edit) See also: Verificationism Intuitively, causation seems to require not just a correlation, but a counterfactual dependence. Suppose that a student performed poorly on a test and guesses that the cause was his not studying. To prove this, one thinks of the counterfactual--the same student writing the same test under the same circumstances but having studied the night before. If one could rewind history, and change only one small thing (making the student study for the exam), then causation could be observed (by comparing version 1 to version 2). Because one can not rewind history and replay events after making small controlled changes, causation can only be inferred, never exactly known. This is referred to as the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference--it is impossible to directly observe causal effects. A major goal of scientific experiments and statistical methods is to approximate as best possible the counterfactual state of the world. For example, one could run an experiment on identical twins who were known to consistently get the same grades on their tests. One twin is sent to study for six hours while the other is sent to the amusement park. If their test scores suddenly diverged by a large degree, this would be strong evidence that studying (or going to the amusement park) had a causal effect on test scores. In this case, correlation between studying and test scores would almost certainly imply causation. Well-designed experimental studies replace equality of individuals as in the previous example by equality of groups. The objective is to construct two groups that are similar except for the treatment that the groups receive. This is achieved by selecting subjects from a single population and randomly assigning them to two or more groups. The likelihood of the groups behaving similarly to one another (on average) rises with the number of subjects in each group. If the groups are essentially equivalent except for the treatment they receive, and a difference in the outcome for the groups is observed, then this constitutes evidence that the treatment is responsible for the outcome, or in other words the treatment causes the observed effect. However, an observed effect could also be caused ``by chance'', for example as a result of random perturbations in the population. Statistical tests exist to quantify the likelihood of erroneously concluding that an observed difference exists when in fact it does not (for example see P-value). Causality predicted by an extrapolation of trends (edit) See also: Inertia See also: Life-time of correlation When experimental studies are impossible and onlypre-existing data are available, as is usually the case for example in economics, regression analysis can be used. Factors other than the potential causative variable of interest are controlled for by including them as regressors in addition to the regressor representing the variable of interest. False inferences of causation due to reverse causation (or wrong estimates of the magnitude of causation due the presence of bidirectional causation) can be avoided by using explanators (regressors) that are necessarily exogenous, such as physical explanators like rainfall amount (as a determinant of, say, futures prices), lagged variables whose values were determined before the dependent variable's value was determined, instrumental variables for the explanators (chosen based on their known exogeneity), etc. See Causality# Statistics and economics. Spurious correlation due to mutual influence from a third, common, causative variable, is harder to avoid: the model must be specified such that there is a theoretical reason to believe that no such underlying causative variable has been omitted from the model. Use of correlation as scientific evidence (edit) This section's factual accuracy is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on Talk: Correlation does not imply causation. Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Much of scientific evidence is based upon a correlation of variables--they are observed to occur together. Scientists are careful to point out that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. The assumption that A causes B simply because A correlates with B is often not accepted as a legitimate form of argument. However, sometimes people commit the opposite fallacy--dismissing correlation entirely, as if it does not suggest causation at all. This would dismiss a large swath of important scientific evidence. Since it may be difficult or ethically impossible to run controlled double-blind studies, correlational evidence from several different angles may be the strongest causal evidence available. The combination of limited available methodologies with the dismissing correlation fallacy has on occasion been used to counter a scientific finding. For example, the tobacco industry has historically relied on a dismissal of correlational evidence to reject a link between tobacco and lung cancer, as did biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. Correlation is a valuable type of scientific evidence in fields such as medicine, psychology, and sociology. But first correlations must be confirmed as real, and then every possible causative relationship must be systematically explored. In the end correlation can be used as powerful evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between a treatment and benefit, a risk factor and a disease, or a social or economic factor and various outcomes. But it is also one of the most abused types of evidence, because it is easy and even tempting to come to premature conclusions based upon the preliminary appearance of a correlation.

A Christmas Story Theatrical release poster Directed by Bob Clark Produced by Rene Dupont Bob Clark Written by Jean Shepherd Leigh Brown Bob Clark Based on In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash 1966 novel by Jean Shepherd Starring Melinda Dillon Darren McGavin Peter Billingsley Narrated by Jean Shepherd Music by Carl Zittrer Paul Zaza Cinematography Reginald H. Morris Edited by Stan Cole Production company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributed by MGM/ UA Entertainment Co. Release date November 18, 1983 (1983-11-18) Running time 93 minutes Country United States Language English Budget$3.2 million Box office$19.3 million A Christmas Story is a 1983 American Christmas comedy film directed by Bob Clark, and based on Jean Shepherd'ssemi-fictional anecdotes in his 1966 book In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, with some elements from his 1971 book Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. A seasonal classic in North America, it is shown numerous times on television, usually on the networks owned by the Turner Broadcasting System. Since 1997, a marathon of the film titled ``24 Hours of A Christmas Story'' has aired annually on TNT and/ or TBS, comprising twelve consecutive airings of the film on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day each year. The film earned director Clark two Genie Awards. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ``culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant''.

Ralphie wanted only one thing for that Christmas: a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. Ralphie's desire is rejected by his mother, his teacher Miss Shields, and even a Santa Claus at Higbee's department store, all giving him the same warning: ``You'll shoot your eye out.'' Christmas morning arrives and Ralphie dives into his presents. Although he does receive some presents he enjoys, Ralphie ultimately is disappointed that he did not receive the one thing he wanted more than anything. After it appears all of the presents have been opened, Ralphie's father, ``The Old Man,'' directs Ralphie to look at one last present that he had hidden. Ralphie opens it to reveal the Red Ryder gun he wanted. Ralphie takes the gun outside and fires it at a target perched on a metal sign in the backyard. However, the BB ricochets back at Ralphie and knocks his glasses off. While searching for them, thinking he has indeed shot his eye out, Ralphie accidentally steps on his glasses and breaks them. He lies to his mother that a falling icicle broke his glasses, and she believes him. Ralphie is in bed on Christmas night with his gun by his side. The adult Ralphie narrates that this was the best present he had ever received or would ever receive. In the other vignettes, The Old Man wins a ``major award'' in a contest, which turns out to be a lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a fishnet stocking, which was derived from the logo for Nehi (pronounced ``knee-high'') pop, a popular soft drink of the period. The Old Man is overjoyed by the lamp, but Mrs. Parker does not like it and a feud over it--referred to by adult Ralphie as ``The Battle of the Lamp''--develops and results in the lamp's ``accidental'' destruction. The Old Man also fights a never-ending battle with the malfunctioning furnace in the Parker home. His frustrations cause him to swear quite often, including one profanity-laden rant that the adult Ralphie says ``is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan.'' Still another source of frustration for The Old Man is the dogs that belong to the next door neighbors, the Bumpuses. The Bumpuses own ``at least 785 smelly hound dogs'' that harass The Old Man whenever he comes home from work. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the family's Christmas dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey. This results in the family having dinner at a Chinese restaurant instead. Ralphie and his friends Flick and Schwartz are tormented by the neighborhood bullies Scut Farkus and Grover Dill. Ralphie eventually snaps and beats up Farkus. Cast (edit) Peter Billingsley as Ralphie Parker Jean Shepherd as adult Ralphie (voice) Ian Petrella as Randy Parker Melinda Dillon as Mrs. Parker Darren McGavin as Mr. Parker (The Old Man) Scott Schwartz as Flick R.D. Robb as Schwartz Zack Ward as Scut Farkus Yano Anaya as Grover Dill Tedde Moore as Miss Shields Jeff Gillen as Santa Claus The screenplay was written by Jean Shepherd, Leigh Brown, and Bob Clark. Several subplots are incorporated into the body of the film, based on other separate short stories by Shepherd. Shepherd provides the film's narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the dramedy television series The Wonder Years. Shepherd, Brown and Clark all have cameo appearances in the film: Shepherd plays the man who directs Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line at the department store; Brown--Shepherd's wife in real life--plays the woman in the Santa line with Shepherd; Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man talks to outside during the Leg Lamp scene. In the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who later appeared in several other Clark films. He cast Melinda Dillon on the basis of her similar role in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Peter Billingsley was already a minor star from appearing in many commercials andco-hosting the TV series Real People; Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie, but decided he was ``too obvious'' a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right choice after all. Ian Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark's film Murder by Decree and was the only onscreen character from A Christmas Story who was played by the same actor in the sequel, My Summer Story. Jeff Gillen was an old friend of Clark's who had been in one of his earliest films. Production (edit) The screenplay for A Christmas Story is based on material from author Jean Shepherd's collection of short stories, In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash. Three of thesemi-autobiographical short stories on which the film is based were originally published in Playboy magazine between 1964 and 1966. Shepherd later read ``Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder nails the Cleveland Street Kid'' and told the otherwise unpublished story ``Flick's Tongue'' on his WOR Radio talk show, as can be heard in one of the DVD extras. Bob Clark states on the DVD commentary that he became interested in Shepherd's work when he heard ``Flick's Tongue'' on the radio in 1968. Additional source material for the film, according to Clark, came from unpublished anecdotes that Shepherd told live audiences ``on the college circuit.'' Locations (edit) The front of the Parkers 'house where A Christmas Story was filmed, in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland's west side. The building has now been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as A Christmas Story House. The film is set in Hohman, Indiana, a fictionalized version of Shepherd's hometown of Hammond, named for Hohman Avenue, which runs through downtown Hammond. Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood). Other local references include mention of a person ``swallowing a yo-yo'' in nearby Griffith, the Old Man being one of the fiercest ``furnace fighters in northern Indiana'' and that his obscenities were ``hanging in space over Lake Michigan,'' a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus ``stretching all the way to Terre Haute, Indiana.'' The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the Bears (whom he jokingly calls the ``Chicago Chipmunks'') and White Sox, consistent with living in northwest Indiana. Director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of Higbee's Department Store in downtown Cleveland. (Since Higbee's was exclusive to northeast Ohio, the department store referenced in Shepherd's book and the film is most likely Goldblatt's, located in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Ave).) Until they connected with Higbee's, location scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee's vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take part in the project on the condition he be allowed to edit the script for cursing. Ultimately, Higbee's was the stage for three scenes in the film: The opening scene in which Ralphie first spies the Red Ryder BB Gun in the store's Christmas window display. Higbee's was known for its elaborate, child-centered Christmas themes and decorations, with Santa as the centerpiece. The parade scene, filmed just outside Higbee's on Public Square at 3 AM. The parade was filmed at night because during the daytime the 1960s Erieview Tower and Federal Building were visible from the Public Square, as was the BP Tower, which was under construction at the time. Ralphie and Randy's visit to see Santa, which was filmed inside Higbee's. The store kept the Santa slide that was made for the film and used it for several years after the film's release. Higbee's became Dillard's in 1992 and closed for good in 2002. In addition to the scenes involving Higbee's, the exterior shots (and select interior shots where Ralphie lived, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood, were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland's West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as ``A Christmas Story House''. Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up. However, Cleveland was only one of several locations used. The school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. The Christmas tree-purchasing scene was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, as was the sound stage filming of interior shots of the Parker home. The ``... only I didn't say fudge'' scene was filmed at the foot of Cherry Street in Toronto; several lake freighters are visible in the background spending the winter at Toronto's port, which lends authenticity to the time of year when the film was produced. In 2008, two fans from Canada released a documentary that visits every location used in the film. Their film, Road Trip for Ralphie, was shot over two years and includes footage of the filmmakers saving Miss Shields 'blackboard from the garbage bin on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating all the original costumes from the film, and tracking down the real-life location of the film's Chop Suey Palace in Toronto. Red Ryder BB gun (edit) Main article: Red Ryder BB Gun The Red Ryder BB gun was available beginning in 1938 and remains available today, but never in the exact configuration mentioned in the film. The Daisy ``Buck Jones'' model did have a compass and a sundial in the stock, but these features were not included in the Red Ryder model. The compass and sundial were placed on Ralphie's BB gun, but on the opposite side of the stock due to Peter Billingsley being left-handed. Dating the Story (edit) Director Bob Clark stated in the film's DVD commentary that he and author Shepherd wished for the film to be seen as ``amorphously late-'30s, early-'40s''. A specific year is never mentioned in the film; however, numerous sources including The New York Times and CBS News have dated the film variously at 1940 to the early 1940s. Soundtrack (edit) A Christmas Story Soundtrack album by Various artists Released November 10, 2009 Recorded Genre Instrumental, holiday Label Rhino Records Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic Release and reception (edit) Initially overlooked as a sleeper film, A Christmas Story was released a week before Thanksgiving 1983 to moderate success, earning about$2 million in its first weekend. Vincent Canby's mostly negative New York Times review echoed the more common response. Roger Ebert suggested the film had only modest success because holiday-themed films were not popular at the time. The film would go on to win two Genie Awards, for Bob Clark's screenplay and direction. By Christmas 1983 the film was no longer playing at most venues, but remained in about a hundred theaters until January 1984. Gross earnings were just over$19.2 million. In the years since, due to television airings and home video release, A Christmas Story has become widely popular and is now an annual Christmas special. The film was produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The rights to the film were acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. after Ted Turner's purchase of MGM'spre-1986 film library. Subsequently, Time Warner purchased Turner Entertainment, and currently holds rights to the film. Over the years, the film's critical reputation has grown considerably and it is considered by some to be one of the best films of 1983. Based on 52 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 89%, with an average score of 8.5/ 10. The site's consensus reads: ``Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous, A Christmas Story deserves its status as a holiday perennial.'' On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating ``generally favorable reviews''. In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling the film ``Delightful'' and ``Truly funny for kids and grown-ups alike'' with ``Wonderful period flavor.'' On December 24, 2007, AOL ranked the film their# 1 Christmas film of all time. IGN ranked the film the top holiday-themed film of all time. In 2012, a Marist Poll named the film the favorite holiday film in the U.S. American Film Institute lists AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs--Nominated AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes: ``You'll shoot your eye out.''--Nominated AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)--Nominated Broadcasting and home Video release (edit) Television (edit) The film first aired on television on HBO in 1985, and quickly attracted a growing following. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the film began airing quietly on SuperStation WTBS and Superstation WGN. In 1988, then-fledgling Fox aired the film the night after Thanksgiving. In 1989--1990, TBS showed it Thanksgiving night, while in 1991--1992, they aired it the night after. 24 Hours of a Christmas Story (edit) Turner Broadcasting has maintained ownership of the broadcast rights, and since themid-1990s, aired the film increasingly on TBS, TNT, and TCM. By 1995, it was aired on those networks a combined six times on December 24--26, and in 1996, it was aired eight times over those three days. Due to the increasing popularity of the film, in 1997, TNT began airing a 24-hour marathon dubbed ``24 Hours of A Christmas Story,'' consisting of the film shown twelve consecutive times beginning at 7 or 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve and ending Christmas Day. This was in addition to various other airings earlier in the month of December. In 2004, after TNT switched to a predominantly drama format, sister network TBS, under its comedy-based ``Very Funny'' moniker, took over the marathon. Clark stated that, in 2002, an estimated 38.4 million people tuned into the marathon at one point or another, nearly one sixth of the country. TBS reported 45.4 million viewers in 2005, and 45.5 million in 2006. In 2007, new all-time ratings records were set, with the highest single showing (8 p.m. Christmas Eve) drawing 4.4 million viewers. Viewership increased again in 2008, with 8 p.m. Christmas Eve drawing 4.5 million viewers, and 10 p.m. drawing 4.3 million, and 54.4 million total. As of 2009, the film had been shown 250 times on the Turner family of networks. In 2007, the marathon continued, and the original tradition was revived. TNT also aired the film twice the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend (November 25). In 2009, the 24-hour marathon continued on TBS, for the 13th overall year, starting at 8 p.m. eastern on Christmas Eve. In 2009, the film aired on TBS during a 24-hour marathon on Christmas Eve. The first viewing at 8 p.m. Eastern on December 24 earned a 1.6 rating (18--49) and beat the major broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox). In 2010, the marathon averaged 3 million viewers, up 2% from the previous year, ranking TBS as the top cable network for the 24-hour period. The 10 a.m. airing on December 25 was seen by 4.4 million viewers, and the 8 p.m. airing on December 24 was close behind with 4.3 million viewers. The marathons in 2011 and 2012 continued to see increases in ratings. For the 2014 and 2015 editions of the marathon, Turner Broadcasting elected to simulcast it on both TNT and TBS, marking the first time since 2003 that TNT aired it as well as the first time the marathon is being carried by multiple stations; the two networks set their airings one hour apart (so that the TNT airings began while TBS was at the middle of the film). Subsequent and earlier works (edit) A sequel involving Ralphie and his family, titled My Summer Story (originally released as It Runs in the Family), was made in 1994. With the exceptions of Tedde Moore as Ralphie's teacher (Miss Shields) and Jean Shepherd as the narrator (the voice of the adult Ralphie), it features an entirely different cast. A series of television films involving the Parker family, also from Shepherd stories, were made by PBS, including Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss (1988), The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski (1985), The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters (1982), and The Phantom of the Open Hearth (1976). A Christmas Story 2 is another sequel which ignores the references and events of My Summer Story and was released direct-to-video in 2012 and directed by Brian Levant. It was filmed in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. Stage adaptations (edit) In 2000, a stage play adaptation of A Christmas Story was written by Philip Grecian. In November 2012, A Christmas Story: The Musical, based on the film, opened on Broadway. Written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (music and lyrics) and Joseph Robinette (book), the musical opened to positive reviews. The run ended December 30, 2012. The musical was directed by John Rando with choreography by Warren Carlyle and featured Dan Lauria as Jean Shepherd. The musical received Tony Award nominations for Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical (Robinette), and Best Original Score (Music and/ or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre. The musical was then adapted for television as A Christmas Story Live!, which aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2017.

Hand Palmar and dorsal aspects of human right handX-ray of human hand Details Vein dorsal venous network of hand Nerve Ulnar, median, radial nerves Identifiers Latin Manus MeSH A01. 378.800. 667 TA A01. 1.00. 025 FMA 9712 Anatomical terminology (edit on Wikidata) A hand is a prehensile,multi-fingered organ located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each ``hand'' and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having ``hands'' instead of paws on their front limbs. The raccoon is usually described as having ``hands'' though opposable thumbs are lacking. Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally--for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand. The human hand normally has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb. In some languages, the human hand is said to have five fingers, including the thumb as one of the fingers. It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies between people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb. The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist. Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones. Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback. They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness--the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning. Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language. Likewise the 10 digits of two hands, and the 12 phalanges of 4 fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.

The scientific use of the term hand in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of anthropomorphism. The only true grasping hands appear in the mammalian order of primates. Hands must also have opposable thumbs, as described later in the text. The hand is located at the distal end of each arm. Apes and monkeys are sometimes described as having four hands, because the toes are long and the hallux is opposable and looks more like a thumb, thus enabling the feet to be used as hands. The word ``hand'' is sometimes used by evolutionary anatomists to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb such as when researching the homology between the three digits of the bird hand and the dinosaur hand. Areas (edit) Human hand parts Areas of the human hand include: The palm (Volar), which is the central region of the anterior part of the hand, located superficially to the metacarpus. The skin in this area contains dermal papillae to increase friction, such as are also present on the fingers and used for fingerprints. The opisthenar area (dorsal) is the corresponding area on the posterior part of the hand. The heel of the hand is the area anteriorly to the bases of the metacarpal bones, located in the proximal part of the palm. It is the area that sustains most pressure when using the palm of the hand for support, such as in handstand. There are five digits attached to the hand, notably with a nail fixed to the end in place of the normal claw. The four fingers can be folded over the palm which allows the grasping of objects. Each finger, starting with the one closest to the thumb, has a colloquial name to distinguish it from the others: index finger, pointer finger, forefinger, or 2nd digit middle finger or long finger or 3rd digit ring finger or 4th digit little finger, pinky finger, small finger, baby finger, or 5th digit The thumb (connected to the first metacarpal bone and trapezium) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm. A reliable way of identifying human hands is from the presence of opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs are identified by the ability to be brought opposite to the fingers, a muscle action known as opposition. Bones (edit) Bones of the human hand Hand-bone animation The skeleton of the human hand consists of 27 bones: the eight short carpal bones of the wrist are organized into a proximal row (scaphoid, lunate, triquetral and pisiform) which articulates with the bones of the forearm, and a distal row (trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and hamate), which articulates with the bases of the five metacarpal bones of the hand. The heads of the metacarpals will each in turn articulate with the bases of the proximal phalanx of the fingers and thumb. These articulations with the fingers are the metacarpophalangeal joints known as the knuckles. The fourteen phalanges make up the fingers and thumb, and are numberedI-V (thumb to little finger) when the hand is viewed from an anatomical position (palm up). The four fingers each consist of three phalanx bones: proximal, middle, and distal. The thumb only consists of a proximal and distal phalanx. Together with the phalanges of the fingers and thumb these metacarpal bones form five rays or poly-articulated chains. Because supination and pronation (rotation about the axis of the forearm) are added to the two axes of movements of the wrist, the ulna and radius are sometimes considered part of the skeleton of the hand. There are numerous sesamoid bones in the hand, small ossified nodes embedded in tendons; the exact number varies between people: whereas a pair of sesamoid bones are found at virtually all thumb metacarpophalangeal joints, sesamoid bones are also common at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (72.9%) and at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the little finger (82.5%) and the index finger (48%). In rare cases, sesamoid bones have been found in all the metacarpophalangeal joints and all distal interphalangeal joints except that of the long finger. The articulations are: interphalangeal articulations of hand (the hinge joints between the bones of the digits) metacarpophalangeal joints (where the digits meet the palm) intercarpal articulations (where the palm meets the wrist) wrist (may also be viewed as belonging to the forearm). Arches (edit) Arches of the hand Red: one of the oblique arches Brown: one of the longitudinal arches of the digits Dark green: transverse carpal arch Light green: transverse metacarpal arch The fixed and mobile parts of the hand adapt to various everyday tasks by forming bony arches: longitudinal arches (the rays formed by the finger bones and their associated metacarpal bones), transverse arches (formed by the carpal bones and distal ends of the metacarpal bones), and oblique arches (between the thumb and four fingers): Of the longitudinal arches or rays of the hand, that of the thumb is the most mobile (and the least longitudinal). While the ray formed by the little finger and its associated metacarpal bone still offers some mobility, the remaining rays are firmly rigid. The phalangeal joints of the index finger, however, offer some independence to its finger, due to the arrangement of its flexor and extension tendons. The carpal bones form two transversal rows, each forming an arch concave on the palmar side. Because the proximal arch simultaneously has to adapt to the articular surface of the radius and to the distal carpal row, it is by necessity flexible. In contrast, the capitate, the ``keystone'' of the distal arch, moves together with the metacarpal bones and the distal arch is therefore rigid. The stability of these arches is more dependent of the ligaments and capsules of the wrist than of the interlocking shapes of the carpal bones, and the wrist is therefore more stable in flexion than in extension. The distal carpal arch affects the function of the CMC joints and the hands, but not the function of the wrist or the proximal carpal arch. The ligaments that maintain the distal carpal arches are the transverse carpal ligament and the intercarpal ligaments (also oriented transversally). These ligaments also form the carpal tunnel and contribute to the deep and superficial palmar arches. Several muscle tendons attaching to the TCL and the distal carpals also contribute to maintaining the carpal arch. Compared to the carpal arches, the arch formed by the distal ends of the metacarpal bones is flexible due to the mobility of the peripheral metacarpals (thumb and little finger). As these two metacarpals approach each other, the palmar gutter deepens. Thecentral-most metacarpal (middle finger) is the most rigid. It and its two neighbors are tied to the carpus by the interlocking shapes of the metacarpal bones. The thumb metacarpal only articulates with the trapezium and is therefore completely independent, while the fifth metacarpal (little finger) issemi-independent with the fourth metacarpal (ring finger) which forms a transitional element to the fifth metacarpal. Together with the thumb, the four fingers form four oblique arches, of which the arch of the index finger functionally is the most important, especially for precision grip, while the arch of the little finger contribute an important locking mechanism for power grip. The thumb is undoubtedly the ``master digit'' of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers. Together with the index and middle finger, it forms the dynamic tridactyl configuration responsible for most grips not requiring force. The ring and little fingers are more static, a reserve ready to interact with the palm when great force is needed. See also: arches of the foot Muscles (edit) Main article: Muscles of the hand Muscles and other structures of wrist and palm The muscles acting on the hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups. The extrinsic muscle groups are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm. Intrinsic (edit) The intrinsic muscle groups are the thenar (thumb) and hypothenar (little finger) muscles; the interosseous muscles (four dorsally and three volarly) originating between the metacarpal bones; and the lumbrical muscles arising from the deep flexor (and are special because they have no bony origin) to insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism. Extrinsic (edit) Extensor compartments of wrist (back of hand) The fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group (opponens and abductor brevis muscle), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible. The extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the anatomical snuff box. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor, used, for instance, pointing. The extensors are situated within 6 separate compartments. Compartment 1 (Most radial) Compartment 2 Compartment 3 Compartment 4 Compartment 5 Compartment 6 (Most ulnar) Abductor pollicis longus Extensor carpi radialis longus Extensor pollicis longus Extensor indicis Extensor digiti minimi Extensor carpi ulnaris Extensor pollicis brevis Extensor carpi radialis brevis Extensor digitorum communis The first four compartments are located in the grooves present on the dorsum of inferior side of radius while the 5th compartment is in between radius and ulna. The 6th compartment is in the groove on the dorsum of inferior side of ulna. Innervation (edit) Cutaneous innervation of the upper limb The hand is innervated by the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. Motor innervation The radial nerve innervates the finger extensors and the thumb abductor, thus the muscles that extends at the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints (knuckles); and that abducts and extends the thumb. The median nerve innervates the flexors of the wrist and digits, the abductors and opponens of the thumb, the first and second lumbrical. The ulnar nerve innervates the remaining intrinsic muscles of the hand. All muscles of the hand are innervated by the brachial plexus (C5--T1) and can be classified by innervation: Nerve Muscles radial Extensors: carpi radialis longus and brevis, digitorum, digiti minimi, carpi ulnaris, pollicis longus and brevis, and indicis. Other: abductor pollicis longus. median Flexors: carpi radialis, pollicis longus, digitorum profundus (half), superficialis, and pollicis brevis (superficial head). Other: palmaris longus. abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and first and second lumbricals. ulnar Flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum profundus (half), palmaris brevis, flexor digiti minimi, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, adductor pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis (deep head), palmar and dorsal interossei, and third and fourth lumbricals. Cutaneous innervation The radial nerve innervates the skin the back of the hand from the thumb to the ring finger and the dorsal aspects of the index, middle, and half ring fingers as far as the proximal interphalangeal joints. The median nerve innervates the palmar side of the thumb, index, middle, and half ring fingers. Dorsal branches innervates the distal phalanges of the index, middle, and half ring fingers. The ulnar nerve innervates the ulnar third of the hand, both at the palm and the back of the hand, and the little and half ring fingers. There is a considerable variation to this general pattern, except for the little finger and volar surface of the index finger. For example, in some individuals, the ulnar nerve supplies the entire ring finger and the ulnar side of the middle finger, whilst, in others, the median nerve supplies the entire ring finger. Skin (edit) Left: papillary ridges of palm Right: sexual dimorphism The glabrous (hairless) skin on the front of the hand, the palm, is relatively thick and can be bent along the hand's flexure lines where the skin is tightly bound to the underlying tissue and bones. Compared to the rest of the body's skin, the hands 'palms (as well as the soles of the feet) are usually lighter--and even much lighter in dark-skinned individuals, compared to the other side of the hand. Indeed, genes specifically expressed in the dermis of palmoplantar skin inhibit melanin production and thus the ability to tan, and promote the thickening of the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum layers of the epidermis. All parts of the skin involved in grasping are covered by papillary ridges (fingerprints) acting as friction pads. In contrast, the hairy skin on the dorsal side is thin, soft, and pliable, so that the skin can recoil when the fingers are stretched. On the dorsal side, the skin can be moved across the hand up to 3 cm (1.2 in); an important input the cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The web of the hand is a ``fold of skin which connects the digits'' ``Web''. Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.). Oxford University Press. September 2005. (Subscription or UK public library membership required.). These webs, located between each set of digits, are known as skin folds (interdigital folds or plica interdigitalis). They are defined as ``one of the folds of skin, or rudimentary web, between the fingers and toes.''. Variation (edit) Further information: Digit ratio The average length of an adult male hand is 189 mm, while the average length of an adult female hand is 172 mm. The average hand breadth for adult males and females is 84 and 74 mm respectively. The ratio of the length of the index finger to the length of the ring finger in adults is affected by the level of exposure to male sex hormones of the embryo in utero. This digit ratio is below 1 for both sexes but it is lower in males than in females on average. Clinical significance (edit)X-ray of the left hand of a ten-year-old boy with polydactyly. A number of genetic disorders affect the hand. Polydactyly is the presence of more than the usual number of fingers. One of the disorders that can cause this is Catel-Manzke syndrome. The fingers may be fused in a disorder known as syndactyly. Or there may be an absence of one or more central fingers--a condition known as ectrodactyly. Additionally, some people are born without one or both hands (amelia). There are several cutaneous conditions that can affect the hand including the nails. The autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis can affect the hand, particularly the joints of the fingers. Some conditions can be treated by hand surgery. These include carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful condition of the hand and fingers caused by compression of the median nerve, and Dupuytren's contracture, a condition in which fingers bend towards the palm and can not be straightened. A similar condition to this is where some of the fingers can not be flexed due to injury to the ulnar nerve. A common fracture of the hand is a scaphoid fracture--a fracture of the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones. This is the commonest carpal bone fracture and can be slow to heal due to a limited blood flow to the bone. There are various types of fracture to the base of the thumb; these are known as Rolando fractures, Bennet's fracture, and Gamekeeper's thumb. Another common fracture, known as Boxer's fracture, is to the neck of a metacarpal. Evolution (edit) ``Hands'' of a Javanese tree shrew and a human The prehensile hands and feet of primates evolved from the mobile hands ofsemi-arboreal tree shrews that lived about 60 million years ago. This development has been accompanied by important changes in the brain and the relocation of the eyes to the front of the face, together allowing the muscle control and stereoscopic vision necessary for controlled grasping. This grasping, also known as power grip, is supplemented by the precision grip between the thumb and the distal finger pads made possible by the opposable thumbs. Hominidae (great apes including humans) acquired an erect bipedal posture about 3.6 million years ago, which freed the hands from the task of locomotion and paved the way for the precision and range of motion in human hands. Functional analyses of the features unique to the hand of modern humans have shown that they are consistent with the stresses and requirements associated with the effective use of paleolithic stone tools. It is possible that the refinement of the bipedal posture in the earliest hominids evolved to facilitate the use of the trunk as leverage in accelerating the hand. While the human hand has unique anatomical features, including a longer thumb and fingers that can be controlled individually to a higher degree, the hands of other primates are anatomically similar and the dexterity of the human hand can not be explained solely on anatomical factors. The neural machinery underlying hand movements is a major contributing factor; primates have evolved direct connections between neurons in cortical motor areas and spinal motoneurons, giving the cerebral cortex monosynaptic control over the motoneurons of the hand muscles; placing the hands ``closer'' to the brain. The recent evolution of the human hand is thus a direct result of the development of the central nervous system, and the hand, therefore, is a direct tool of our consciousness--the main source of differentiated tactile sensations--and a precise working organ enabling gestures--the expressions of our personalities. A gorilla, a large extant primate with small thumbs, and the hand skeleton of Ardipithecus ramidus, a large Pliocene primate with relatively human-like thumbs There are nevertheless several primitive features left in the human hand, including pentadactyly (having five fingers), the hairless skin of the palm and fingers, and the os centrale found in human embryos, prosimians, and apes. Furthermore, the precursors of the intrinsic muscles of the hand are present in the earliest fishes, reflecting that the hand evolved from the pectoral fin and thus is much older than the arm in evolutionary terms. The proportions of the human hand are plesiomorphic (shared by both ancestors and extant primate species); the elongated thumbs and short hands more closely resemble the hand proportions of Miocene apes than those of extant primates. Humans did not evolve from knuckle-walking apes, and chimpanzees and gorillas independently acquired elongated metacarpals as part of their adaptation to their modes of locomotion. Several of primitive hand features most likely present in the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor (CHLCA) and absent in modern humans are still present in the hands of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Homo floresiensis. This suggests that the derived changes in modern humans and Neanderthals did not evolve until 2.5 to 1.5 million years ago or after the appearance of the earliest Acheulian stone tools, and that these changes are associated with tool-related tasks beyond those observed in other hominins. The thumbs of Ardipithecus ramidus, an early hominin, are almost as robust as in humans, so this may be a primitive trait, while the palms of other extant higher primates are elongated to the extent that some of the thumb's original function has been lost (most notably in highly arboreal primates such as the spider monkey). In humans, the big toe is thus more derived than the thumb. There is a hypothesis suggesting the form of the modern human hand is especially conducive to the formation of a compact fist, presumably for fighting purposes. The fist is compact and thus effective as a weapon. It also provides protection for the fingers. However, this is not widely accepted to be one of the primary selective pressures acting on hand morphology throughout human evolution, with tool use and production being thought to be far more influential.

The executive producers for the first production season were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. The series was originally set to debut in autumn 1989 with the episode ``Some Enchanted Evening'', which was meant to introduce the main characters; during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone. The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' as the first episode of the series. The first season won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations.

Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family. The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. The animators merelyre-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Production (edit) In 1989, a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created in-house. Due to the increased workload of the full-length episodes, production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM. While character and background layout is done by the domestic studio, tweening, coloring, and filming are done by the overseas studio. The Simpsons wasco-developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along and were often in conflict over the show; Groening once described their relationship as ``very contentious''. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called ``the mainstream trash'' that they were watching. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. Fox was nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audience's attention for the duration of the episode. They proposed doing three seven-minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted, but in the end, the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full-length episodes. Simon assembled and led the initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Simon has been credited as ``developing (the show's) sensibility''. Ken Levine says he ``brought a level of honesty to the characters'' and made them ``three-dimensional'', adding that Simon's ``comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking? '--that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters.'' Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve ``what (he) didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows (he had) worked on... (he) wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works.'' The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs, who would depart the show at the end of the season. The series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode ``Some Enchanted Evening'', which was meant to introduce the main characters. A debacle erupted when the episode ``Some Enchanted Evening'', the first to return from animation in Korea, was screened in front of the production staff at the Gracie Films bungalow. The executive producer and developer James L. Brooks 'initial reaction to the animation was ``This is shit.'' After that reaction the room almost cleared. A heated argument ensued between Brooks and Klasky-Csupo animation studio head G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3, who denied that there was anything wrong with the animation and suggested that the real problem was the quality of the show's writing. The problem with the animation from the producers 'point-of-view was that it did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time there were only a few choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either. However, during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone. The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode (``Bart the Genius'') turned out as bad, but it only suffered from a few, easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' as the first episode of the series. The half hour series premiere debuted on December 17, 1989 with ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' a Christmas special. The next episode ``Bart the Genius'' was the first to feature the series 'full title sequence, including the chalkboard gag and couch gag. Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed. In some of the episodes the characters act completely differently to how they do in later seasons; Lisa, for example, is undisciplined and short-tempered, while Homer is the voice of reason; these roles are reversed in later episodes. Mr. Burns, was voiced by Christopher Collins in ``Homer's Odyssey''. Originally, the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan, a concept which was later dropped. The first episode featured many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis. Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers can be heard over the speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen. The following episodes in the season saw the introduction of several new recurring characters, including Martin Prince, Richard, Edna Krabappel, Dr. J Loren Pryor, Waylon Smithers, Otto Mann, Chief Wiggum, Jasper Beardley, Sam& Larry, Mr.& Mrs. Winfield, Sherri and Terri, Dr. Marvin Monroe, Eddie and Lou, Nelson Muntz, Herman, Bleeding Gums Murphy, Jacqueline Bouvier, Sideshow Bob, Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Krusty the Clown, Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolphin ``Dolph'' Starbeam, Ms. Albright, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Lenny and Carl, Kent Brockman and Agnes Skinner. Reception (edit) Ratings (edit) The Simpsons first season was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. It won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations. Although television shows are limited to one episode a category, ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' was considered a separate special, and nominated alongside fellow episode ``Life on the Fast Lane'' for Outstanding Animated Program; ``Life on the Fast Lane'' won the award. ``Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'' was also nominated for ``Outstanding Editing in a Miniseries or Special'', while ``The Call of the Simpsons'' was nominated for ``Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special''. The main theme song, composed by Danny Elfman, was nominated for ``Outstanding Achievement in Main Title Theme Music''. Reception (edit) On Metacritic, a site which uses a weighted mean score, the season scored a 79/ 100 from six critics, translating to ``generally favorable reviews.'' However, the show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents to characterize him as a poor role model for children. Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption ``Underachiever ('And proud of it, man! ')''. Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$ 2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.

The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing British colonies, which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the Australian Constitution, which was drawn up at a Constitutional Convention and ratified by the people of the colonies at referendums. The Australian head of state is the Queen of Australia who is represented by the Governor-General of Australia, with executive powers delegated by constitutional convention to the Australian head of government, the Prime Minister of Australia. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into the executive branch, composed of the Federal Executive Council presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the Cabinet of Australia led by the Prime Minister, the legislative branch composed of the Parliament of Australia's House of Representatives and Senate, and the judicial branch composed of the High Court of Australia and federal courts. Separation of powers is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III). The Australian system of government combines elements of the Westminster and Washington systems with unique Australian characteristics, and has been characterised as a ``Washminster mutation''. Contents 1 Structure 2 Legislature 3 Executive 3.1 Head of state 3.2 Executive Council 3.3 Cabinet 3.4 Departments 4 Judiciary 5 Publicly owned entities 5.1 Corporations prescribed by acts of parliament 5.2 Government Business Enterprises 5.3 Other publicnon-financial corporations 6 See also 7 References 7.1 Footnotes 7.2 Citations 8 External links Structure (edit) The three branches of the federal government of Australia The legislature: Parliament House in Canberra, the seat of the Federal Parliament The Executive: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (left) representing the Federal Executive Council, and Governor-General Peter Cosgrove (right) who by convention follows the Council's advice The judiciary: The High Court of Australia, the nation's highest court Section 1 of the Australian Constitution creates a democratic legislature, the bicameral Parliament of Australia which consists of the Queen of Australia, and two houses of parliament, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 51 of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as ``heads of power'') to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six States (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The High Court of Australia arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions. The Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a ``double majority'': a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States. The Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This ``transfer'' legislation may have a ``sunset clause'', a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored. In addition, Australia has several ``territories'', two of which are self-governing: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT). These territories 'legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth; the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers. Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. The territory of Norfolk Island was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament. The other territories that are regularly inhabited--Jervis Bay, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands--have never been self-governing. The federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The House of Representatives is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus New South Wales has 48 members while Tasmania has only five. But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators. The third level of government after Commonwealth and State/ Territory is Local government, in the form of shires, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either councillor or alderman, depending on the State), usually serving part-time. Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located. Government at the Commonwealth level and the State/ Territory level is undertaken by threeinter-connected arms of government: Legislature: The Commonwealth Parliament Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments Judiciary: The High Court of Australia and subsidiary Federal courts. The Separation of powers is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other: the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms; the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both statute law and the common law; the Australian courts can not give an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of a law, but the High Court of Australia can determine whether an existing law is constitutional the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth or State/ Territory government; but the Legislature and the Executive should not try to influence its decisions. Until the passage of the Australia Act 1986, and associated legislation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, some Australian cases could be referred to the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal. With this act, Australian law was made unequivocally sovereign, and the High Court of Australia was confirmed as the highest court of appeal. The theoretical possibility of the British Parliament enacting laws to override the Australian Constitution was also removed. Legislature (edit) Main article: Parliament of Australia The Australian Senate chamber The Australian House of Representatives chamber The Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The Australian Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the Queen of Australia, a 76-member Senate and a 150-member House of Representatives. Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using proportional representation and the single transferable vote (known in Australia as ``quota-preferential voting'': see Australian electoral system), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the Northern Territory (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory (which for this purpose includes the Jervis Bay Territory). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed; it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election. The members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential voting using thenon-proportional Instant-runoff voting system from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories. In ordinary legislation, the two chambers haveco-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing Westminster system, the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on 2 July 2016. The Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the Westminster system, with a recognised Leader of the Opposition, usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who ``shadow'' each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses. The day-to-day business of the House of Representatives is usually negotiated between the Leader of the House, appointed by the Prime Minister, and the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Commonwealth parliament, currently Bill Shorten. Executive (edit) Head of state (edit) Main articles: Monarchy of Australia and Governor-General of Australia The Australian Constitution dates from 1901, when the Dominions of the British Empire were not sovereign states, and does not use the term ``head of state''. As Australia is a constitutional monarchy, government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state. In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the Queen of Australia and the Governor-General of Australia, who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits. Government House, Canberra The Sovereign of Australia, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is also the Sovereign of fifteen other Commonwealth realms including the United Kingdom. Like the other Dominions, Australia gained legislative independence from the Parliament of the United Kingdom by virtue of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title Queen of Australia, and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as Queen of the United Kingdom and Defender of the Faith as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia. Section 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2010 General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth '. Section 2 of the Australian Constitution provides that a Governor-General shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen. Under the conventions of the Westminster system the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains reserve powers similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor-General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister. Australia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a 1999 referendum, the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor-General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The Australian Republican Movement continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and Australian Monarchist League. Further information: Constitutional history of Australia, Australian republicanism, and Australian head of state dispute Executive Council (edit) Main article: Federal Executive Council (Australia) The Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled ``The Honourable'', a title which they retain for life. The Governor-General usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as theVice-President of the Executive Council presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, theVice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator Mathias Cormann. There are times when the government acts in a ``caretaker'' capacity, principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election. Cabinet (edit) Main articles: Cabinet of Australia and List of Australian Ministers The Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister. The Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office ofVice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General. Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 Robert Menzies created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the front bench. This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government. When thenon-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party or its predecessor the Country Party, the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios. When the Labor first held office under Chris Watson, Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the Caucus, and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the 2007 general election, the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would. The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne. Kevin Rudd was in favour of the Cabinet meeting in other places, such as major regional cities. There are Commonwealth Parliament Offices in each State Capital, with those in Sydney located in Phillip Street. Departments (edit) There are 18 departments of the Australian Government. Attorney-General's Department Department of Agriculture and Water Resources Department of Communications and the Arts Department of Defence Department of Education and Training Department of Employment Department of the Environment and Energy Department of Finance Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Department of Health Department of Home Affairs Department of Human Services Department of Industry, Innovation and Science Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Department of Social Services Department of the Treasury Department of Veterans 'Affairs Judiciary (edit) Main article: Australian court hierarchy Courtroom 1 in the High Court in Canberra. As a federation, in Australia judicial power is exercised by both federal and state courts. Federal judicial power is vested in the High Court of Australia and such other federal courts created by the Federal Parliament, including the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia, and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Additionally, unlike in the United States, the federal legislature has the power to enact laws which vest federal jurisdiction in State courts. Since the Australian Constitution requires a separation of powers at the federal level, only courts may exercise federal judicial power; and conversely,non-judicial functions can not be vested in courts. State judicial power is exercised by each State's Supreme Court, and such other courts and tribunals created by the State Parliaments. The High Court is the final court of appeal in Australia and has the jurisdiction to hear appeals on matters of both federal and state law. It has both original and appellate jurisdiction, the power of judicial review over laws passed by federal and State parliaments, and has jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution of Australia. Unlike in the United States, there is only one common law of Australia, rather than separate common laws for each State. Publicly owned entities (edit) Corporations prescribed by acts of Parliament (edit) The following corporations are prescribed by Acts of Parliament: Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983) Special Broadcasting Service (Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991) Government business Enterprises (edit) The following corporate Commonwealth entities are prescribed as Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) by section 5 (1) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (PGPA) Rule: Australian Postal Corporation (``Australia Post'') Defence Housing Australia The following Commonwealth companies are prescribed as GBEs by section 5 (2) of the PGPA Rule: ASC Pty Ltd Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited (ACN 161 635 105) NBN Co Limited (ACN 136 533 741) Other publicnon-financial corporations (edit) Airservices Australia Snowy Hydro Limited See also (edit) Australian federal budget Australian Public Service Referendums in Australia (andnon-binding plebiscites) Second Turnbull Ministry References (edit) Footnotes (edit)^ Prior to 1931, the junior status of dominions was shown in the fact that it was British ministers who advised the King, with dominion ministers, if they met the King at all, escorted by the constitutionally superior British minister. After 1931 all dominion ministers met the King as His ministers as of right, equal in Commonwealth status to Britain's ministers, meaning that there was no longer either a requirement for, or an acceptance of, the presence of British ministers. The first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the Irish Free State. Australia and other dominions soon followed.

PAH is one of three members of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, a class of monooxygenase that uses tetrahydrobiopterin (BH, a pteridine cofactor) and anon-heme iron for catalysis. During the reaction, molecular oxygen is heterolytically cleaved with sequential incorporation of one oxygen atom into BH and phenylalanine substrate. Reaction catalyzed by PAH Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of the metabolic pathway that degrades excess phenylalanine. Research on phenylalanine hydroxylase by Seymour Kaufman led to the discovery of tetrahydrobiopterin as a biological cofactor. The enzyme is also interesting from a human health perspective because mutations in PAH, the encoding gene, can lead to phenylketonuria, a severe metabolic disorder. Contents (hide) 1 Enzyme mechanism 2 Enzyme regulation 3 Structure 3.1 Catalytic domain 3.2 N-terminal regulatory domain 3.3 Tetramerization domain 4 Biological function 5 Disease relevance 6 Related enzymes 7 References 8 Further reading 9 External links Enzyme mechanism (edit) The reaction is thought to proceed through the following steps: formation of a Fe (II)-O-O-BH bridge. heterolytic cleavage of theO-O bond to yield the ferryl oxo hydroxylating intermediate Fe (IV)= O attack on Fe (IV)= O to hydroxylate phenylalanine substrate to tyrosine. PAH mechanism, part I Formation and cleavage of the iron-peroxypterin bridge. Although evidence strongly supports Fe (IV)= O as the hydroxylating intermediate, the mechanistic details underlying the formation of the Fe (II)-O-O-BH bridge prior to heterolytic cleavage remain controversial. Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the pterin cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe O and Fe O. The activated O then attacks BH, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient pterin ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species. The Fe (II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed. On the other hand, formation of this bridge has been modeled assuming that BH4 is located in iron's first coordination shell and that the iron is not coordinated to any water molecules. This model predicts a different mechanism involving a pterin radical and superoxide as critical intermediates. Once formed, the Fe (II)-O-O-BH bridge is broken through heterolytic cleavage of theO-O bond to Fe (IV)= O and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin; thus, molecular oxygen is the source of both oxygen atoms used to hydroxylate the pterin ring and phenylalanine. PAH mechanism, part II Hydroxylation of phenylalanine by ferryl oxo intermediate. Because the mechanism involves a Fe (IV)= O (as opposed to a peroxypterin) hydroxylating intermediate, oxidation of the BH cofactor and hydroxylation of phenylalanine can be decoupled, resulting in unproductive consumption of BH4 and formation of H2O2. When productive, though, the Fe (IV)= O intermediate is added to phenylalanine in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that reduces iron from the ferryl to the ferrous state. Although initially an arene oxide or radical intermediate was proposed, analyses of the related tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylases have suggested that the reaction instead proceeds through a cationic intermediate that requires Fe (IV)= O to be coordinated to a water ligand rather than a hydroxo group. This cationic intermediate subsequently undergoes a 1, 2-hydride NIH shift, yielding a dienone intermediate that then tautomerizes to form the tyrosine product. The pterin cofactor is regenerated by hydration of the carbinolamine product of PAH to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH), which is then reduced to BH. Enzyme regulation (edit) PAH is proposed to use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation. Mammalian PAH exists in an equilibrium consisting of tetramers of two distinct architectures, with one or more dimeric forms as part of the equilibrium. This behavior is consistent with a dissociative allosteric mechanism. Many studies suggest that mammalian PAH shows behavior comparable to porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), wherein a variety of factors such as pH and ligand binding are reported to affect enzyme activity and protein stability. Structure (edit) The PAH monomer (51.9 kDa) consists of three distinct domains: a regulatory N-terminal domain (residues 1-117), the catalytic domain (residues 118-427), and a C-terminal domain (residues 428-453) responsible for oligomerization of identical monomers. Extensive crystallographic analysis has been performed, especially on the pterin-and iron-coordinated catalytic domain to examine the active site. The structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain has also been determined, and together with the solved structure of the homologous tyrosine hydroxylase C-terminal tetramerization domain, a structural model of tetrameric PAH has been proposed. Model of the active site of PAH bound to BH4, ferrous, and a phenylalanine analogue. (from PDB 1KW0) Phenylalanine analogue, BH4, iron, Fe (II)-coordinated His and Glu residues Catalytic domain (edit) Solved crystal structures of the catalytic domain indicate that the active site consists of an open and spacious pocket lined primarily by hydrophobic residues, though three glutamic acid residues, two histidines, and a tyrosine are also present and iron-binding. Contradictory evidence exists about the coordination state of the ferrous atom and its proximity to BH4 within the active site. According to crystallographic analysis, Fe (II) is coordinated by water, His285, His290, and Glu330 (a 2-his-1-carboxylate facial triad arrangement) with octahedral geometry. Inclusion of a Phe analogue in the crystal structure changes both iron from a six-to a five-coordinated state involving a single water molecule and bidentate coordination to Glu330 and opening a site for oxygen to bind. BH4 is concommitantly shifted toward the iron atom, although the pterin cofactor remains in the second coordination sphere. On the other hand, a competing model based on NMR and molecular modeling analyses suggests that all coordinated water molecules are forced out of the active site during the catalytic cycle while BH4 becomes directly coordinated to iron. As discussed above, resolving this discrepancy will be important for determining the exact mechanism of PAH catalysis. N-terminal regulatory domain (edit) The regulatory nature of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-117) is conferred by its structural flexibility. Hydrogen/ deuterium exchanges analysis indicates that allosteric binding of Phe globally alters the conformation of PAH such that the active site is less occluded as the interface between the regulatory and catalytic domains is increasingly exposed to solvent. This observation is consistent with kinetic studies, which show an initially low rate of tyrosine formation for full-length PAH. This lag time is not observed, however, for a truncated PAH lacking the N-terminal domain or if the full-length enzyme ispre-incubated with Phe. Deletion of the N-terminal domain also eliminates the lag time while increasing the affinity for Phe by nearlytwo-fold; no difference is observed in the V or K for the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor. Additional regulation is provided by Ser16; phosphorylation of this residue does not alter enzyme conformation but does reduce the concentration of Phe required for allosteric activation. This N-terminal regulatory domain is not observed in bacterial PAHs but shows considerable structural homology to the regulatory domain of phosphogylcerate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the serine biosynthetic pathway. Tetramerization domain (edit) Prokaryotic PAH is monomeric, whereas eukaryotic PAH exists in an equilibrium between homotetrameric and homodimeric forms. The dimerization interface is composed of symmetry-related loops that link identical monomers, while the overlapping C-terminal tetramerization domain mediates the association of conformationally distinct dimers that are characterized by a different relative orientation of the catalytic and tetramerization domains (Flatmark, Erlandsen). The resulting distortion of the tetramer symmetry is evident in the differential surface area of the dimerization interfaces and distinguishes PAH from the tetramerically symmetrical tyrosine hydroxylase. A domain-swapping mechanism has been proposed to mediate formation of the tetramer from dimers, in which C-terminal alpha-helixes mutually alter their conformation around a flexible C-terminal five-residue hinge region to form a coiled-coil structure, shifting equilibrium toward the tetrameric form. Although both the homodimeric and homotetrameric forms of PAH are catalytically active, the two exhibit differential kinetics and regulation. In addition to reduced catalytic efficiency, the dimer does not display positive cooperativity toward L-Phe (which at high concentrations activates the enzyme), suggesting that L-Phe allosterically regulates PAH by influencing dimer-dimer interaction. Biological function (edit) PAH is a critical enzyme in phenylalanine metabolism and catalyzes the rate-limiting step in its complete catabolism to carbon dioxide and water. Regulation of flux through phenylalanine-associated pathways is critical in mammalian metabolism, as evidenced by the toxicity of high plasma levels of this amino acid observed in phenylketonuria (see below). The principal source of phenylalanine is ingested proteins, but relatively little of this pool is used for protein synthesis. Instead, the majority of ingested phenylalanine is catabolized through PAH to form tyrosine; addition of the hydroxyl group allows for the benzene ring to be broken in subsequent catabolic steps. Transamination to phenylpyruvate, whose metabolites are excreted in the urine, represents another pathway of phenylalanine turnover, but catabolism through PAH predominates. In humans, this enzyme is expressed both in the liver and the kidney, and there is some indication that it may be differentially regulated in these tissues. PAH is unusual among the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases for its involvement in catabolism; tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, on the other hand, are primarily expressed in the central nervous system and catalyze rate-limiting steps in neurotransmitter/ hormone biosynthesis. Disease relevance (edit) Deficiency in PAH activity due to mutations in the PAH gene causes hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and when blood phenylalanine levels increase above 20 times the normal concentration, the metabolic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) results. PKU is both genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous: Over 300 distinct pathological mutants have been identified, the majority of which correspond to missense mutations that map to the catalytic domain. When a cohort of identified PAH mutants were expressed in recombinant systems, the enzymes displayed altered kinetic behavior and/ or reduced stability, consistent with structural mapping of these mutations to both the catalytic and tetramerization domains of the enzyme. BH4 has been administered as a pharmacological treatment and has been shown to reduce blood levels of phenylalanine for a segment of PKU patients whose genotypes lead to some residual PAH activity but have no defect in BH4 synthesis or regeneration. Follow-up studies suggest that in the case of certain PAH mutants, excess BH4 acts as a pharmacological chaperone to stabilize mutant enzymes with disrupted tetramer assembly and increased sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage and aggregation. Mutations that have been identified in the PAH locus are documented at the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Locus Knowledgbase (PAHdb,http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca/). Since phenylketonuria can cause irreversible damage, it is imperative that deficiencies in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase are determined early on in development. One method is apost-parturition screening test known as the Guthrie Test. The common method is via drawing blood from a small needle prick at the heel of the newborn and testing it for phenylketonurea, indicative of a PH deficiency. Placing the individual on a low phenylalanine, high tyrosine diet can help prevent any long-term damage to their development. Related enzymes (edit) See also: Biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylase Phenylalanine hydroxylase is closely related to two other enzymes: tryptophan hydroxylase (EC number 1.14. 16.4), which controls levels of serotonin in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract tyrosine hydroxylase (EC number 1.14. 16.2), which controls levels of dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine in the brain and the adrenal medulla. The three enzymes are homologous, that is, are thought to have evolved from the same ancient hydroxylase.

Anna Frozen character First appearance Frozen (2013) Created by Chris Buck Jennifer Lee Voiced by Kristen Bell Livvy Stubenrauch (5 years old, speaking) Katie Lopez (5 years old, singing) Agatha Lee Monn (9 years old, singing) Information Title Princess of Arendelle Family The King and Queen of Arendelle (parents) Queen Elsa of Arendelle (older sister) Princess Anna of Arendelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios '53rd animated film Frozen. She is voiced by Kristen Bell as an adult. At the beginning of the film, Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provided her speaking and singing voice as a young child, respectively. Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing). Created byco-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, Anna is loosely based on Gerda, a character from the Danish fairytale ``The Snow Queen'' by Hans Christian Andersen. In the Disney film adaptation, Anna is depicted as the princess of Arendelle, a fictional Scandinavian kingdom and the younger sister of Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel), who is the heiress to the throne and possesses the elemental ability to create and control ice and snow. When Elsa exiles herself from the kingdom after inadvertently sending Arendelle into an eternal winter on the evening of her coronation, fearless and faithful Anna is determined to set out on a dangerous adventure to bring her sister back and save both her kingdom and her family. The original fairytale in general and the character of the Snow Queen in particular posed long-term problems to adapt into a feature-length production. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, made their attempts towards the story and numerous adaptations were shelved as the filmmakers could not work out the characters. Finally, directors Buck and Lee solved the issue by portraying Anna and Elsa as sisters, establishing a dynamic relationship between the characters. Anna has received widespread acclaim from film critics, who praised the determination and enthusiasm in her personality. Bell was also extolled by various reviewers for her performance in the film.

Attempts to produce an adaption of ``The Snow Queen'' in the Disney studio dated back to 1943, when Walt Disney considered collaborating with Samuel Goldwyn to produce a biography film of Hans Christian Andersen. However, the story and particularly the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators. Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main protagonist, Gerda (who later served as an inspiration for Anna), and the Snow Queen. Most obviously, Andersen's version did not feature any confrontation between them: when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay, the Snow Queen is nowhere to be seen. There just was not enough character conflict to form a full-length feature. Later on, Glen Keane, Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi, Harvey Fierstein, Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen, but none of them made their way. Around 2008, Chris Buck pitched Disney his version of The Snow Queen. At the time, the project was planned to be traditionally animated under the name of Anna and the Snow Queen. However, by early 2010, the project encountered the same problem and was stuck again. Jennifer Lee, Frozen'sco-director, later recalled, ``The issue with the original for us in a lot of ways is it's a very symbolic story. It's very hard to translate symbolism into concrete things. Film is concrete, so you translate it.'' After the success of Tangled (2010), on December 22, 2011, Disney announced a release date, November 27, 2013, for the film, together with a new title, Frozen, and Peter Del Vecho and John Lasseter took up as the project's producers. Now, when the film was revived again, one of the main challenges that Buck and his team had to face with was the character. The storyboards were presented to John Lasseter, who would tell the assembled production team ``You haven't dug deep enough.'' Lasseter commended that Chris Buck's latest version was fun and very light-hearted, but the characters were not multifaceted, and thus did not resonate for the producer. The original character of Gerda, known as Anna, was one of the three major characters in the script at this time, along with the Snow Queen, Elsa and Kristoff, loosely based on Kay. The characters were not considered to be well-rounded or relatable, but an interpersonal, family dynamic was created once Anna and Elsa were established as sisters, an idea suggested by someone on the writing team that no one remembered who. This changed the story dramatically, shifting from the conflict between the good and the evil to the conflict between love and fear. Buck stated that their script still retained basic parts of the story and the character of Gerda, citing the similarities between the original story and his version, ``(Gerda) won't give up on finding her friend Kai. The only thing she really has in her, she's not a superhero or anything, but she has love. And it's love that conquers fear in the end.'' Voice (edit) Kristen Bell provided the voice for Anna On March 5, 2012, Kristen Bell was cast to voice the adult Anna. Livvy Stubenrauch was chosen to portray Anna as a young child, while Katie Lopez, daughter of the husband-and-wife songwriting team of the film, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, provided the singing voice for young Anna in ``Do You Want to Build a Snowman?'' musical sequence. Additionally, Agatha Lee Monn, daughter of the film's director Jennifer Lee, portrayed teenage Anna in this song. Lee explained about these casting decisions, ``We really wanted to use the first two verses of this song to show you Anna's personality. And we wanted the singing to be done by real-sounding kids, not necessarily Broadway kids.'' Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel (who voiced Elsa in the film) had both auditioned for Rapunzel in Tangled and had already known each other, but they did not get the part. Talking about her feelings when she got the part, Bell expressed, ``Since I was 4 years old, I dreamed of being in a Disney animated film,'' she said. ``It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed like it would be a very unrealistic one.'' She described Disney movies as ``the ones (she) watched over and over again when (she) was a kid,'' and continued, ``I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, ``Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead--the ``princess,'' I guess--didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing ``I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone.'''' Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as ``I was in glee''. Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including ``Part of Your World'' that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna. The two directors, Buck and Lee, were also impressed by how Kristen and Idina related. ``During one of our early read-throughs, Kristen and Idina sang a ballad to each other which had so much emotion that everyone in the room was in tears,'' Buck said. ``It not only showed how great their voices were together, but showed the power the music would have in the story.'' However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with herco-star as ``nerve-racking''. The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called ``Wind Beneath My Wings'', in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice. Regarding the songs that she performed in the film, Kristen said, ``We're singing the lovely songs of Kristen and Bobby Lopez, who wrote 'Book of Mormon. 'So it's really, really funny music. It's really good music. They're amazing to work for.'' Director Jennifer Lee strongly believed that there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, ``It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice (during auditions), not knowing that she had been classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna.''Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, ``Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which.'' Idina Menzel was also surprised by herco-star's singing ability, stating that, ``I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down.'' Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for ``the rest of (her) life'' if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice ``lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces.'' During production, Bell and Menzel had to do a lot of recordings andre-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. ``We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that,'' said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made them really interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had tore-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as ``cool and weird and surreal and jarring'', saying that she was really proud that Anna ``came out like she did that (the directors) let (Bell) do her like this.'' Design and characterization (edit) Anna in particular and the whole film in general had undergone a number of changes in the story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, ``Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of it that we didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so we changed some of the animation to support it.'' Bell generally described her character as ``She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined.'' Lee added, ``She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing.'' Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, ``(Anna's) secret weapon is love,'' while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is ``a character who is willing to stand beside you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong.'' In the images of Frozen's main characters released by Disney in July 2013, Anna and her role in the film was described as follows: Anna is more daring than graceful and, at times, can act before she thinks. But she's also the most optimistic and caring person you'll ever meet. She longs to reconnect with her sister, Elsa, as they were close during their childhood. When Elsa accidentally unleashes a magical secret that locks the kingdom of Arendelle in an eternal winter, Anna embarks on a dangerous adventure to make things right. Armed with only her fearlessness, a never-give-up attitude and her faith in others, Anna is determined to save both her kingdom and her family. ``I'm really excited to show it to people. I became a part of the kind of movie I wanted to see as a kid,'' she said. ``I always loved Disney animation, but there was something about the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that.''--Kristen Bell on her approach to the character of Anna. In order to have one person fully understand and develop their own character, as well as later be able to impart that to the crew, the film's directors and producers decided to have character leads and supervising animators on specific characters. First-time character lead Becky Bresee serves as the supervising animator for Anna. She described her job as ``making the character more believable''. To achieve this, she had to act out part of a sequence in the movie between Anna and Kristoff for a number of times, each of them emphasizing the character's gestures differently. ``Anna's a little bit nervous and uncomfortable, and I had to find a way to put that into the animation,'' explained Bresee. Bell said that at first Anna was written plainer and more general. ``In the first draft of the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of specific and very girly,'' which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always wanted to be part of Disney animated feature, but she ``wanted to be a very specific type of princess'', who ``was way more awkward than the normal princesses'', not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress 'own personality to the character, embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a ``typical Disney moment'', as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some ``nonsensical rambling''. ``I think I said, ``This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait--what?'' Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack.'' Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell ``wanted her to also have hair in her mouth'', which took inspiration from her own real life. ``Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on.'' Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress 'biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed. ``I think I'll be the most proud of this character for a long time. There was so much of me that was put into this character. There was a lot of collaboration, and not just in the fact of, here is the character, and here is what I want to bring, and here is what you want to bring. I really wanted to infuse her with who I am. I wanted the heart behind it to be that things didn't come to her; the birds didn't come and braid her hair. She went out and fought for things. I'm really proud that little girls will be able to see that, because that's what I wanted. So I will be thinking about her for a while.''--Kristen Bell on Anna's influence to her in the future. When asked about Anna's biggest charm, Bell said that ``her charm is caught somewhere between her sincerity and optimism. Anna is genuine, sincere and compounded with optimism, and eternally optimistic people are the most charismatic people, much more attractive than those with a bad mood.'' She also expressed why the character seemed to loveable to her, ``To have Anna in a situation where she starts the movie without any friends, because her lifestyle hasn't allowed her to have a full kingdom. She runs around, because she wants friends.'' Bell called the film's story is ``another turning point'' for Disney animation because the love depicted in this story is the love between siblings, anon-romantic love. Anna wants the world and she wants to explore, but she also wants to nurture the relationships around her, particularly the family relationship. ``It's verynon-traditional for a Disney movie,'' she added. Regarding Bell's influence on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality was just so fun and energetic. ``We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character,'' he said. He also admitted that he ``fell in love with (Bell)'s voice and (Bell)'s spirit''. Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. ``So she was a fantastic collaborator,'' Lee added. Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, ``The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced.'' They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell. From left to right: Anna's coronation dress, her winter travel outfit and her summer casual wear. Anna's costumes in the film were informed by the research of Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials should be used for the costumes.Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring ``playful'' floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated dresses, that allows movements, giving the character a free range of ``twirl (ing) all she wants'' throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are running around in the snow, they have to have petticoats, undergarments, capes, ``and they have all these layers and layers of things that are all meticulously designed,'' Brittney explained. Character model (edit) Anna has distinguishable facial features of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs on the bottom of her dress. Appearances (edit) Frozen (edit) Main article: Frozen (2013 film) Anna is the younger child in the royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born with the power to create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's abilities to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers--a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents 'funeral. Three years later, when Elsa becomes a young adult, she is set to be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously preparing for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened for the first time since the sisters 'childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans 'marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests '(including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle. At a trading post on her journey, Anna meets a mountain man named Kristoff, an ice harvester who agrees to lead her to the North Mountain, where he knows that a magical phenomenon has occurred and helps her escape a pack of wolves, resulting in his sled being destroyed after falling down into a large hole and catching on fire. The duo and Kristoff's reindeer Sven, where being chased by wolves on the way and encounter the sister's snowman, Olaf, who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa and later leads them to her palace. The sisters reunite, but Elsa is reluctant to help Anna by ending the eternal winter. Upset, she loses control of her powers, striking Anna in her heart. Desperate to get her sister to leave, Elsa creates a giant snow creature, and it throws Anna and her friends away from the palace. Upon noticing Anna's hair is turning white, Kristoff takes her back to his adoptive family of trolls. Pabbie tells Anna that her heart has been frozen by her sister's magic and only an act of true love can save her from freezing completely. Kristoff, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will heal her, takes Anna back to the kingdom. Meanwhile, Hans has led a group of soldiers to the ice palace. Elsa's defenses are not enough and she is taken back to Arendelle's dungeon unconscious. At the castle, Anna's request for a kiss is denied by Hans, who reveals their engagement was merely a ploy to seize the throne of Arendelle. He locks Anna in her room without a fire, leaving her to die. Hans falsely claims that Anna is already dead and that they spoke their marriage vows before she died, making him the ruler of Arendelle. Olaf aids Anna while revealing to her Kristoff's love for her. Elsa also escapes into the fjord, her fears triggering a massive blizzard, but breaks down in shock when Hans tells her that she killed Anna and the blizzard stops. While the end of the storm allows Anna to reunite with Kristoff, she sees Hans ready to kill Elsa, and with her final breath, she stops him from killing her sister and inadvertently knocks him unconscious just as she freezes solid--a result of the earlier accident. As Elsa grieves for her sister, Anna begins to thaw, since her choice to sacrifice herself to save her elder sister rather than herself constitutes ``an act of true love''. Realizing love is the key to controlling her powers, Elsa is able to thaw the kingdom and use her magic safely in public. Anna confronts Hans and punches him in the face, making him fall off the ship into the water. She then buys Kristoff a previously-promised new sled and they share a kiss, starting their new relationship. Anna and Elsa's sisterly bond is rekindled, with Elsa promising never to shut the castle gates again, much to Anna's joy. Once Upon a time (edit) Main article: Once Upon a Time (TV series) Anna Once Upon a Time character First appearance ``A Tale of Two Sisters'' (4.01) Last appearance ``Heroes and Villains'' (4.11) Created by Edward Kitsis Adam Horowitz Portrayed by Elizabeth Lail Information Aliases Joan Occupation Princess of Arendelle Family Queen Gerda and the King of Arendelle (parents) Elsa (older sister) Ingrid/ Snow Queen and Helga (maternal aunts) Significant other (s) Kristoff (husband) Centric episodes ``A Tale of Two Sisters'' ``White Out'' ``The Apprentice'' ``Breaking Glass'' ``Family Business'' ``The Snow Queen'' ``Smash the Mirror'' ``Fall'' ``Shattered Sight'' ``Heroes and Villains'' Anna appears in the fourth season of Once Upon a Time, with actress Elizabeth Lail portraying the character. Following the events of the film Frozen, Anna is preparing to wed Kristoff when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their real reason for their parents 'fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets David, a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in swordsmanship so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord Bo Peep. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of Rumplestiltskin, a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying she has given the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave--but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power--due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has no magic as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff. With the introduction of Frozen characters, the season 4 of Once Upon a Time saw a 31-percent increase in ratings from the autumn of 2013 (9.3 million viewers), marking its best ratings in almost two years. Frozen fever (edit) Main article: Frozen Fever Nearly a year after the events of the movie, Elsa throws a birthday for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake for themselves, and she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains. Olaf's Frozen Adventure (edit) Main article: Olaf's Frozen Adventure Anna will appear in a 21-minute Frozen holiday film along with Elsa, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf, which will debut in theaters with Disney Pixar's Coco on November 22, 2017. Miscellaneous (edit) Merchandise (edit) Anna meet-and-greet at Disneyland in California in 2013. On November 6, 2013, Disney Consumer Products began releasing a line of merchandise featuring Anna in Disney Store and other retailers. Various versions of Anna dolls include the fashion doll set, themini-doll set, plush doll, Anna-as-a-toddler doll, and a special version called Musical Magic Elsa and Anna Dolls, which lights up and plays their signature songs that appear in the film when users hold their hands or they hold each other's hands. Anna's merchandise also covers a wide range of other products, such as rolling luggage, boots, clothes, nightgowns, bowls, plates, coffee mugs, and home d\u00e9cors. In addition, the film was adapted as simplified storybooks for children, with diverse versions featuring sound effects, original character voices, and mini projectors that project movie images on the wall. One of those books, called A Sister More Like Me, includes illustrations by Brittney Lee, the film's visual development artist. Both Anna and Elsa appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity through the use of their corresponding figurines. Theme Parks (edit) In November 2013, prior to the release of Frozen, Anna and Elsa began daily meet-and-greet sessions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in Florida and California, US. In Walt Disney World, the sisters had their debut on October 22, 2013, in a temporary attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios while their main attractions in Epcot were being built, then officially made appearances in the Norway Pavilion of Epcot on November 2, 2013, alongside a gallery of Norwegian culture which the film's setting and design drew inspirations from. A cottage called the ``Royal Reception'' was set up in the Fantasyland section of Disneyland, featuring the pair and an audio-animatronic Olaf speaking on the cottage roof. In February 2014, these meet-and-greet sessions were extended indefinitely, with wait time to meet the princesses frequently exceeding two hours, which is longer than any previous Disney characters. As of March 2014, it was reported that this wait time had reached four or five hours. Additionally, Elsa, Anna, and Olaf were given a Frozen-themed float for Disneyland Paris 'Disney Magic on Parade. On March 9, 2014, the three made appearances again on their own Frozen parade float in Festival of Fantasy Parade at Magic Kingdom theme park, Walt Disney World, with Anna showing up in her coronation dress for the first time in a Disney park. On April 20, 2014, Anna and Elsa moved from Epcot to the Princess Fairytale Hall at Magic Kingdom, with wait time to see the characters amounted to three hours, comparing to Cinderella and Rapunzel's 15 minutes. Anna made a few appearances in Disney California Adventure's Winter Dreams, a 30-minute, winter-themed new show of the nighttime spectacle World of Color with Olaf, the show's host, and Elsa. Disneyland Paris's nighttime spectacular Disney Dreams! featured Anna as the Frenchco-narrator of the show, alongside the English-speaking Olaf. Scenes from the original film, featuring Anna and other characters like Olaf and Kristoff, appear on the castle while Elsa is singing ``Let It Go'', during the Frozen segment in the Magic Kingdom nighttime projection show, Celebrate the Magic. Coinciding with the film's release, Anna began making meet-and-greet sessions aboard the Disney Cruise Line's Disney Dream cruise ship. On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Disneyland would debut a Frozenpre-parade featuring Anna, Elsa, and Olaf. It premiered June 13, 2014, and preceded performances of Mickey's Soundsational Parade. From July 5 to September 1, 2014, as part of 'Frozen 'Summer Fun show at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Anna and Elsa will appear in a horse-drawn sleigh making their way down Hollywood Boulevard, alongside Kristoff and skaters, skiers and ice cutters in the Anna and Elsa's Royal Welcome section. The sisters also made appearances in For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration, where they were joined by royal historians to retell the history of Arendelle; and ``Frozen'' Fireworks Spectacular alongside Kristoff and Olaf, a fireworks display set to the music of Frozen. Other characters from the film will also appear in their respective offerings: Olaf in Olaf on Summer Vacation, the Oaken's family in Wandering Oaken's Trading Post& Frozen Funland, and ``Coolest Summer Ever'' Dance Party featuring a DJ and live band. In response to strong demand, Disney Parks subsequently announced on August 7 that Frozen Summer Fun would be extended to September 28. On August 19, 2014, it was initially announced that Elsa& Anna's Boutique (replacing Studio Disney 365) would openmid-September in Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort. The opening date was later changed to October 6, 2014, and the store name was changed to ``Anna& Elsa's Boutique''. The location includes products inspired by Anna, Elsa, and Olaf. While there hadn't been any official announcements from Disney regarding a coronation for Anna and Elsa, it had been announced in late August 2014 that a special character meal would be held by a group of travel agents in the morning of September 24, 2014. While not officially organized by Disney, the event, called My Royal Coronation, would feature the official Anna and Elsa characters owned by Disney with assistance from the company. On September 12, 2014, Walt Disney World announced that a Frozen attraction was scheduled to open in early 2016 at Epcot's World Showcase in the Norway pavilion, replacing the park's Maelstrom ride. The attraction features the kingdom of Arendelle with music and scenes from the film, as well as meet-and-greets with Anna and Elsa. Anna, Elsa, Kristoff, and Olaf will make appearances in Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade, offered during Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic Kingdom in November and December 2014 (from November 7 to December 31). On November 13, 2014, prior to ``A Sparkling Christmas'' Evert, Anna and Elsa began meet-and-greet sessions at Hong Kong Disneyland. Beginning December 20, 2014, the Anna and Elsa meet and greet at Disneyland Resort was moved from Disneyland park to a new location in the Disney Animation Building called ``Anna and Elsa's Royal Welcome'' in Disney California Adventure. In addition, the Storybook Land Canal Boats at Disneyland were updated to include the village of Arendelle from the film, including Anna and Elsa's castle. Officially starting January 7, 2015, Anna began making appearances alongside Elsa and Kristoff at Disney California Adventure in ``For the First Time in Forever--A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration'' in Hollywood Land as part of the park's ``Frozen Fun'' event. Also starting January 7, Anna and Elsa are making appearances in a Frozen play at the Royal Theatre in Disneyland park. Beginning May 22, 2015, Disneyland debuted a new nighttime parade called ``Paint the Night'', which includes a Frozen float featuring Anna, Elsa, and Olaf, as part of the park's 60th anniversary celebration. Broadway Musical (edit) Patti Murin will originate the role of Anna in the upcoming Broadway musical, which is scheduled to open spring 2018. Reception (edit) Critical reviews (edit) ``What's so great about Frozen is that we get two strong heroines, both complex and flawed whose journeys are incredibly identifiable. Anna is plucky and socially awkward and that's great because many girls will identify with a girl who isn't necessarily naturally poised like some of the original princesses. This is a girl who hasn't had much human contact and when she does just explodes into unfiltered extroversion and naivet\u00e9.''--Sabina Ibarra, Geek Exchange film critic. Collider.com writer Matt Goldberg referred to Anna as a character who ``can go from cute to melancholy to odd to defiant and never miss a beat''. Emma Koonse of Christian Post described her and Elsa as the ``most lovable and charismatic characters yet'', while Tony Hicks of San Jose Mercury News wrote that both Anna and Elsa were depicted as devoted from the start, and ``(Anna's) confusion and Elsa's anguish as she shuts herself away from the world--and her sister--is palatable.'' Deepanjana Pal from First Post commented that Anna ``is very much a child who needs to grow up and she does in the course of the film.'' The Wall Street Journal suggested that the character become more endearing for being ``exactly the free spirit she seems to be''. Noah Lee of The Coast News was impressed by the heroine duo Anna and Elsa, and said, ``I never lost interest in the drastic measures Anna took or the tribulations Elsa faced.'' Travis Bean, a reviewer of Community Newspaper Group put emphasis on the lessons that kids could perceive from the film, saying, ``Children can also root for Anna to race through the forest and break through Elsa's icy walls and prove that love conquers all fears.'' Linda Barnard, Toronto Star film critic, described the sisters as ``engaging female characters'', particularly praised Anna for her funny and iron-willed characteristics. Sabina Ibarra from Geek Exchange commended that the directors had crafted two very real girls ``who come into their own and also come together in this amazing tale.'' Kristen Bell was lauded for her performance as Anna in the film. Michelle Im, writing for the Eye of the Tiger referred to the character as ``bubbly and spirited'', and commented, ``Not only was (Bell) able to nail those vibratos and belting notes in her songs, it was actually her singing them.'' The Coast News review of the film wrote that Bell ``earns top marks'' for instilling a spirited sensibility in the clumsy but well-meaning Anna. Cinenerd, a film critic for Blogcritics, commended the actress 'singing ability, stating that she and Menzel ``sing their hearts out, with two showstoppers in Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever''. Colin Covert of Colorado Springs 'The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a ``flawless delivery''. Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, ``There's so much to love about Frozen, but at the top of the list is the emphasis on (Anna) and Elsa's relationship. Anna still has an infatuation with the charming Hans and romantic chemistry with the flustered Kristoff, but her greatest love is for her sister. (Elsa) is mostly scared and guilt-ridden. She's an incredibly sympathetic character, and it's a fresh spin on depicting estrangement between siblings. Anna has so much life and enthusiasm, and we want to see her share it with Elsa.'' Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as ``what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it'', commenting, ``the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss--something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love.'' Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, ``Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love,'' while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula. Noah Lee described Anna and Elsa's relationship as ``genuine'', saying, ``watching those themes of family and love versus isolation and fear touched my heart in more ways than one.'' However, the character was not without criticisms. Michelle Im from the Eye of the Tiger referred to Anna's falling immediately in love with a prince as the only personal development in her character, and found it ``disappointing'' in comparison with Elsa's emotionally evolving personality. Anna Smith of The Guardian disliked that both Anna and Elsa were drawn with slender figures and large eyes as is typical of Disney princesses. Accolades (edit) Both Anna and Elsa were nominated for Best Animated Female by the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, with only Anna winning the award. Frozen also won Women Film Critics Circle award in the same category. References (edit)^ Jump up to: Lee, Jennifer (September 23, 2013). ``Frozen's Final Shooting Draft'' (PDF).

The engagement ring is usually worn on the outside. Engagement process in Azerbaijan An engagement ring is a ring indicating that the person wearing it is engaged to be married, especially in Western cultures. A ring is presented as an engagement gift by a partner to their prospective spouse when they propose marriage or directly after a marriage proposal is accepted. It represents a formal agreement to future marriage. In Western countries, engagement rings are worn mostly by women, and rings can feature diamonds or other gemstones. In some cultures men and women wear matching rings, and engagement rings may also be used as wedding rings. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the ring is customarily worn on the left hand ring finger, but customs vary considerably elsewhere across the world. Neither the engagement nor any other ring is worn during the wedding ceremony, when the wedding ring is put by the groom on the finger of the bride as part of the ceremony, and sometimes by the bride onto the groom's finger. After the wedding, the engagement ring is usually put back on, and is usually worn on the outside of the wedding ring. Some brides have their engagement and wedding rings permanently soldered together after the wedding. Contents (hide) 1 History 1.1 Ancient times 1.2 Middle ages 1.3 Renaissance 1.4 Reformation 1.5 Enlightenment 1.6 Victorian era 1.7 20th century 2 Purchase 3 Legal ownership 4 Styles 5 For men 6 See also 7 References 8 External links History (edit) Ancient Times (edit) Although the ancient Egyptians are sometimes credited with having invented the engagement ring, and the ancient Greeks with having adopted the tradition, the history of the engagement ring can only be reliably traced as far back as ancient Rome. In many countries, engagement rings are placed on the ring finger of the left hand. At one time it was believed that this finger contained a vein (the vena amoris) that led to the heart. This idea was popularized by Henry Swinburne in A treatise of Spousals, or Matrimonial Contracts (1686). The story seems to have its origin in the ancient Roman book Attic Nights by Aulus Gellius quoting Apion's Aegyptiacorum, where the alleged vein was originally a nervus (a word that can be translated either as ``nerve'' or ``sinew''). The popular belief that an engagement ring was originally part of the bride price which represented purchase and ownership of the bride, has been called into question by contemporary scholarship. In the second century BC, the Roman bride-to-be was given two rings, a gold one which she wore in public, and one made of iron which she wore at home while attending to household duties. At one time Roman citizens wore rings made of iron. In later years senators who served as ambassadors were given gold seal rings for official use when abroad. Later the privilege of wearing gold rings was extended to other public officials, then to the knights, later to all freeborn, and finally under Justinian, to freedmen. For several centuries it was the custom for Romans to wear iron rings at home, gold rings in public. During this period a girl or woman might receive two engagement rings, one of iron and one of gold. Middle ages (edit) Themid-7th century Visigothic Code required ``that when the ceremony of betrothal has been performed,..., and the ring shall have been given or accepted as a pledge, although nothing may have been committed to writing, the promise shall, under no circumstances, be broken.'' In 860 AD, Pope Nicholas I wrote a letter to Boris I of Bulgaria in reply to questions regarding differences between Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox practices. Pope Nicholas describes how in the Western church the man gives his betrothed an engagement ring. At the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, convoked by Pope Innocent III, the banns of marriage was instituted, prohibiting clandestine marriages and requiring that marriages be made public in advance. Some legal scholars have seen in this a parallel with the engagement-ring tradition described by Pope Nicholas I. Renaissance (edit) The first well-documented use of a diamond ring to signify engagement was by the Archduke Maximilian of Austria in imperial court of Vienna in 1477, upon his betrothal to Mary of Burgundy. This then influenced those of higher social class and of significant wealth to give diamond rings to their loved ones. Reformation (edit) During the Protestant Reformation the wedding ring replaced the betrothal ring as the primary ring associated with marriage. In Catholic countries the transition took place somewhat later. There is a modern belief that in early colonial New England, where Puritans shunned ornaments and jewels, a thimble substituted for both engagement ring and wedding ring; and some women would remove the tops of the thimble in order to create a ring. Some researchers strongly believe this to be just a myth without basis in reality. Enlightenment (edit) During the Age of Enlightenment both the gimmal rings and posie rings were popular, although the latter was more often used as an expression of sentiment than to indicate a formal engagement. Victorian era (edit) In South Africa, diamonds were first found in 1866, although they were not identified as such until 1867. By 1872, the output of the diamond mines exceeded one million carats per year. As production increased, those of lesser means were able to join in on this movement. However, diamond engagement rings were for a long time seen as the domain of the nobility and aristocracy, and tradition often favoured simpler engagement bands. 20th century (edit) In the United States, the popularity of diamond engagement rings declined after World War I, even more so after the onset of the Great Depression. In 1938, the diamond cartel De Beers began a marketing campaign that would have a major impact on engagement rings. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the price of diamonds collapsed. At the same time, market research indicated that engagement rings were going out of style with the younger generation. While the first phase of the marketing campaign consisted of market research, the advertising phase began in 1939. One of the first elements of this campaign was to educate the public about the 4 Cs (cut, carats, color, and clarity). In 1947 the slogan ``a diamond is forever'' was introduced. Ultimately, the De Beers campaign sought to persuade the consumer that an engagement ring is indispensable, and that a diamond is the only acceptable stone for an engagement ring. Purchase (edit) In the 20th century, if he could afford it, the typical Western groom privately selected and purchased an engagement ring, which he then presented to his desired bride when he proposed marriage. In countries where both partners wear engagement rings, matching rings may be selected and purchased together. In the United States and Canada, where only women traditionally wear engagement rings, women also occasionally present their partners with an engagement gift. Like all jewelry, the price for an engagement ring varies considerably depending on the materials used: the design of the ring, whether it includes a gemstone, the value of any gemstone, and the seller. The price of the gemstones, if any, in the ring depends on the type and quality of the gem. Diamonds have a standardized description that values them according to their carat weight, color, clarity and cut. Other gemstones, such as sapphires, rubies, emeralds, have different systems. These may be chosen to honor a family tradition, to use family heirlooms, to be unique, to be socially responsible (they are not associated with blood diamonds or the pollution caused by gold mining and cyanide process), to fit the individual's stylistic preferences, or to manage cost. Synthetic stones and diamond substitutes such as cubic zirconias and moissanites are also popular choices that are socially responsible and reduce cost while maintaining the desired appearance. The idea that a man should spend a significant fraction of his annual income for an engagement ring originated from De Beers marketing materials in themid-20th century in an effort to increase the sale of diamonds. In the 1930s, they suggested that a man should spend the equivalent of one month's income in the engagement ring; later they suggested that he should spend two months 'income on it. In 2012, the average cost of an engagement ring in USA as reported by the industry was US$4,000. In the UK, estimates of the average cost of an engagement ring range from\u00a3 1200 to\u00a3 2000. One reason for the increased popularity of expensive engagement rings is its relationship to human sexuality and the woman's marriage prospects. In the United States, until the Great Depression, a man who broke off a marriage engagement could be sued for breach of promise. Monetary damages included actual expenses incurred in preparing for the wedding, plus damages for emotional distress and loss of other marriage prospects. Damages were greatly increased if the woman had engaged in sexual intercourse with her fianc\u00e9. Beginning in 1935, these laws were repealed or limited. However, the social and financial cost of a broken engagement was no less: marriage was the only financially sound option for most women, and if she was no longer a virgin, her prospects for a suitable future marriage were greatly decreased. The diamond engagement ring thus became a source of financial security for the woman. The online purchase of engagement rings is growing, disrupting the market for the diamonds by bringing greater transparency to an industry that has traditionally relied on opacity. Online diamond retailers ande-commerce platforms include Blue Nile, Brilliant Earth, and Costco. Legal ownership (edit) Tradition generally holds that if the betrothal fails because the man himself breaks off the engagement, the woman is not obliged to return the ring. This reflects the ring's role as a form of compensation for the woman's damaged reputation. Legally, this condition can be subject to either a modified or a strict fault rule. Under the former, the fianc\u00e9 can demand the return of the ring unless he breaks the engagement. Under the latter, the fianc\u00e9 is entitled to the return unless his actions caused the breakup of the relationship, the same as the traditional approach. However, a no-fault rule is being advanced in some jurisdictions, under which the fianc\u00e9 is always entitled to the return of the ring. The ring only becomes the property of the woman when marriage occurs. An unconditional gift approach is another possibility, wherein the ring is always treated as a gift, to be kept by the fianc\u00e9e whether or not the relationship progresses to marriage. Recent court rulings have determined that the date in which the ring was offered can determine the condition of the gift. E.g. Valentine's Day and Christmas are widely recognized as gift giving holidays in the United States and some other countries. A ring offered in the form of a Christmas present is likely to remain the personal property of the recipient in the event of a breakup. In most states of the United States, engagement rings are considered ``conditional gifts'' under the legal rules of property. This is an exception to the general rule that gifts can not be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of Meyer v. Mitnick, 625 N.W. 2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: ``the so-called 'modern trend 'holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently conditional gift, once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was 'at fault, 'is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases.'' Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is blocked by statute, as many states have statutes which state that no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry. One case in New South Wales, Australia ended in the man suing his former fianc\u00e9e because she threw the ring away, after he told her she could keep it even though the marriage plans had fallen through. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that, despite what the man said, the ring remained a conditional gift (partly because his saying that she could keep it reflected his desire to salvage the relationship) and she was ordered to pay him its A$15,250 cost. In England and Wales, the gift of an engagement ring is presumed to be an absolute gift to the fianc\u00e9e. This presumption may be rebutted however by proving that the ring was given on condition (express or implied) that it must be returned if the marriage did not take place, for whatever reason. This was decided in the case Jacobs v Davis (1917). Styles (edit) This wedding set contains two separate rings, either of which could be worn separately. This wedding set contains two separate rings that look incomplete separately. Engagement rings, like any other kind of jewelry, come in many different styles. Gold (Available in Yellow Gold, White Gold and Rose Gold) and platinum are preferred for engagement rings, but common metal types such as titanium, silver, and stainless steel are also used for engagement rings. This allows for the bride-to-be to exert her own individual style into the ring in a simple manner. In the United States, where engagement rings are worn by women, diamonds have been widely featured in engagement rings since the middle of the 20th century. Solitaire rings have one single diamond. The most common setting for engagement rings is the solitaire prong setting, which was popularized by Tiffany& Co. in 1886 and its six-claw prong setting design sold under the ``Tiffany setting'' trademark. The modern favorite cut for an engagement ring is the brilliant cut, which provides the maximum amount of sparkle to the gemstone. The traditional engagement rings may have different prong settings and bands. Another major category is engagement rings with side stones. Rings with a larger diamond set in the middle and smaller diamonds on the side fit under this category. Three-stone diamond engagement rings, sometimes called trinity rings or trilogy rings, are rings with three matching diamonds set horizontally in a row with the bigger stone placed in the center. The three diamonds on the ring are typically said to represent the couple's past, present, and future, but other people give religious significance to the arrangement. A wedding set, or bridal set, includes an engagement ring and a wedding band that matches and can be bought as a set. In some cases, the wedding ring looks ``incomplete''; it is only when the two halves, engagement and wedding, are assembled that the ring looks whole. In other cases, a wedding set consists of two rings that match stylistically and are worn stacked, although either piece would look appropriate as a separate ring. Although the wedding band is not to be worn until the wedding day, the two rings are usually sold together as a wedding set. After the wedding, the bride may choose to have the two pieces welded together, to increase convenience and reduce the likelihood of losing one of the rings. A trio ring set includes a ladies engagement ring, ladies wedding band and a men's wedding band. These sets often have matching rings and are lower in price. In Nordic countries, engagement rings are worn by both men and women. Traditionally they are plain gold bands, although more ornate designs and other materials are gaining popularity. The engagement rings resemble the wedding bands sold in the United States, whereas women's wedding rings may resemble US engagement rings. In North America and the United Kingdom, it is customarily worn on the left hand ring finger. Similar traditions purportedly date to classical times, dating back from an early usage reportedly referring to the fourth finger of the left hand as containing the vena amoris or ``vein of love''. This custom may have its origins in an ancient Egyptian myth that the finger contained a vein leading directly to the heart, or it may simply be because the heart lies slightly to the left side of the body. In Germany the ring is worn on the left hand while engaged, but moved to the right hand when married. In Poland and Turkey, the engagement ring and wedding band are traditionally worn on the right hand but modern practice varies considerably. For men (edit) In some countries it is common for both men and women to wear engagement rings. The rings are often in the form of a plain band of a precious metal. Sometimes, the engagement ring eventually serves as the wedding ring for the man. In Brazil, for example, the groom and bride-to-be usually wear a plain wedding band on the right hand during the course of their engagement. After the wedding, the band is moved to the left hand. In Argentina, it is also known for the groom and bride-to-be to wear a plain silver band on the left hand while engaged. Then, after the wedding the silver band is either replaced with the wedding ring or moved to the right hand. Traditionally, women in the British Isles may propose marriage to men during a leap year. Women proposing has become more common in recent years, to the point that some jewelry companies have started manufacturing men's engagement rings. They resemble typical men's rings, often with a diamond centrepiece. In the countries where both sexes have traditionally worn engagement rings, the rings tend to be plainer bands, and there is no real difference between men's and women's engagement ring designs.

It was written by Shonda Rhimes and directed by Rob Corn. The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on May 20, 2010. The episode was the second part of the two-hour season six finale, the first being Sanctuary, and took place at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. The original episode broadcast in the United States had an audience of 16.13 million viewers and opened up to universal acclaim. The episode centers a shooting spree at the hospital by a former patient's husband Gary Clark (MichaelO'Neill). The episode marked the last appearances for Nora Zehetner and Robert Baker as Dr. Reed Adamson and Dr. Charles Percy respectively as both the characters were killed in the shooting. In the episode Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) try to save the life of Chief Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) who was shot by Gary Clark in front of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) as she waits outside the OR with April Kepner (Sarah Drew). Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) tries to save Charles along with her patient Mary Portman (Mandy Moore), while Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) tries to get into the hospital. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) are stuck on a floor with all the younger patients of the hospital, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) try to save the life of Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) who was shot as well and Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) and Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) try to get their patient to safety. Contents (hide) 1 Plot 2 Production 3 Reception 3.1 Broadcast 3.2 Reviews 4 References 5 External links Plot (edit) The hospital is hit with an unprecedented crisis: a shooter is in the hospital, and there is a lockdown. Meanwhile, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) discovers that she is pregnant, and Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) must choose between Teddy and Cristina (Sandra Oh). The shooter kills Reed Adamson and wounds Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Lexie (Chyler Leigh) and Mark (Eric Dane) find the latter and try to save him. Soon, it is revealed that the shooter, Gary Clark (whose wife was a patient at the hospital and later died), is looking for Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). At the end, he shoots Derek, which is witnessed by Meredith, Cristina, and April. With the crisis unfolding, each character is put through extreme trials and tribulations. Cristina is put under pressure to save Derek, who is seriously injured. Meanwhile, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and her patient Mary drag intern Charles Percy, who has been shot, through the hallway but when they get to the elevators, they are off. Bailey freaks out for a moment, then gathers herself and sits with Charles. When he asks if he was dying, she said yes. She tells him she and Mary are going to stay with him and that he isn't alone, with Charles dying soon thereafter. The shooter walks into the OR where Cristina and Jackson are trying to save Derek. Hunt shows up and Meredith tells him what was going on. He looks through the window and says she is doing fine but he'd go in to see what he could do to help. When Hunt goes inside, the audience is shown that Mr. Clark is in the room with a gun to Cristina's head, shouting at her to stop fixing Derek. Cristina and Avery refuse to stop working. Mr. Clark tells Hunt that he'd shoot him first and then Cristina but he really only wanted to kill Derek. He believes this is retribution for his wife's death, which he believes is on Derek's hands. Meredith then comes into the room and tells Mr. Clark to shoot her. She explains that she is Lexie's sister, she is the closest thing Webber has to a daughter, and she is Derek's wife. He turns the gun toward Meredith, but Cristina says Meredith is pregnant. Hunt makes a move toward Mr. Clark and is shot, knocking him unconscious. Cristina and Avery then raise their hands and Avery tells Mr. Clark that Derek will die and he can watch it happen on the monitor. Derek flatlines and Meredith cries almost hysterically. Mr. Clark walks out. Clark later comes across Lexie, who is bringing supplies to help Alex, and when he attempts to shoot her, the recently arrived SWAT team wounds Clark. This gives time for Lexie to escape. Soon after, Webber walks through the halls of the hospital and finds several bodies. In a room, he finds Mr. Clark, who tells him he'd bought the gun at a superstore and bought extra ammo because it was on sale. Mr. Clark tells Webber he has one bullet left. He reveals that he planned on shooting Webber, then himself. Eventually, after Webber convinces Clark that his wife wouldn't want the shooting and would rather be reunited with him, Clark commits suicide as the SWAT team is directly out the door. Meanwhile, in the operating room, Derek's heartbeat returns to normal, and everyone is relieved. Outside the hospital, Arizona and Callie reinstate their relationship when Callie says she doesn't want to have a baby if it means she can't be with Arizona. Arizona agrees to have a baby because she says that she doesn't want to stop Callie from being an excellent mother. Mark and Lexie show up at the other hospital. Alex is out of surgery. Lexie goes to Alex. Mark watches Lexie take Alex's hand. Meredith takes another look at her positive pregnancy test, and throws it out. Production (edit) Mandy Moore guest starred in the episode as a patient of Miranda Bailey. The episode was written by showrunner Shonda Rhimes and directed by Rob Corn. In an interview Rhimes told that the writing of the two-part season six finale, caused her struggle. She elaborated on this: `` It hurt to write this finale. It literally hurt me. Because in order to write these episodes, I had to walk in the shoes of (the shooter). I had to think like a shooter. A person who would shoot Reed and Alex and Charles. A person who would shoot Derek. By the time I finished writing part one, I was sick. And depressed. Because my McDreamy was lying on my beloved catwalk dying. Mer is screaming and he is dying. And, before you have me shot up with Thorazine and placed in a strait jacket, yes, I DO I know it's only a TV show, I'm not insane, but dude... it felt too real. It felt WAY too real.'' TV Guide reported that Mandy Moore will check into Grey's Anatomy's two-hour season finale, adding, ``She'll play a patient named Mary as part of an explosive--and, of course, top secret--cliffhanger. Bailey--who's having one hell of a season as a newly single gal--will be her doctor, but beyond that, details are being kept under heavily guarded wraps.'' The news was later confirmed by Entertainment Weekly which further reported, ``Bailey--who's having one hell of a season as a newly single gal--will be her doctor, but beyond that, details are being kept under heavily guarded wraps. She comes as part of a grand tradition of recognizable names as patients, usually quick, juicy roles like Sara Gilbert's euthanized patient two weeks ago and Demi Lovato's upcoming stretch as a schizophrenic. Moore did that other hospital show, Scrubs'' It was also reported as veteran actor MichaelO'Neill would reprise his role as the grief-stricken widower Gary Clark.O'Neill later in an interview said, ``That role changed my career. It was probably the hardest job I've ever done, hardest work I've ever done. I had a tremendous resistance to it, and I almost turned the role down. I was so afraid of that being sensationalized, and I didn't want that in the world. I hadn't worked with Shonda Rhimes, and so I didn't know. I certainly knew she was a brilliant writer, but I didn't know what the intent was. We had a conversation about it. I said, 'You know what? Can I think about this and call you back tomorrow? 'I called her back, and I said, 'Shonda, I just have to say it frightens me. It really frightens me. 'She said, 'Michael, it frightens me too. 'I thought, OK, we're at least starting at the same place. Her writing was so good... We saw the wound. We got to see the wound that drove him mad, and I think that was terribly important. It was important to show the fracture that brought this man to that desperate action.'' Reception (edit) Broadcast (edit) Death And All His Friends was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on May 20, 2010. The episode was the second half of the two-hour season six finale, the other half being Sanctuary It had an audience in The United States of 16.13 million viewers (5.9/ 17 Nielsen rating in its 9: 00 Eastern time-slot. Reviews (edit) Sandra Oh (left) and Ellen Pompeo (right) garnered enormous praise for their performances as Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey The episode opened up to universal acclaim with the television critics lauding the writing and performance of the entire cast as well. The performances of guest stars Mandy Moore and MichaelO'Neill along with Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Chandra Wilson, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens, Jr. and Sarah Drew garnered most praise. Marsi from TVFanatic highly praised the episode and gave it five stars, and expressed that it may have been the best episode of the series, adding, ``The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program.'' John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding, ``(It was) two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale.'' PopSugar called it ``most intense episodes of Grey's I have ever seen'' adding, ``What a whopper of an episode! Can we talk about how gripping the scene is where Bailey and Percy are hiding from Mr. Clark. Then he turns around and gets Karev right in the chest. Seriously, I haven't been so shocked by a one-two shooting spree since Michael shot Ana Lucia and Libby in rapid succession on Lost. Another review from BuddyTV called the finale ``Game changing!'' stating, ``The finale that changes everything! You don't want to miss it! To her credit GA creator and writer-of-this-episode Shonda Rhimes pretty much delivered on her promise. I found myself with my heart in my mouth for the entire evening before finally being able to exhale as the credits rolled.'' The review lauded Ellen Pompeo and Sandra Oh adding, ``The Twisted Sisters really were the showcase of the entire finale. Meredith, side-lined for much of the season, took center stage'' even calling Oh's Cristina Yang a ``rockstar''. Entertainment Weekly wrote, ``You're still pondering how Grey's can still be so damn good sometimes,'' further hugely praising the episode, ``They did a bang-up job, it felt real in every way, thanks to some stellar performances and writing. And yet it maintained itsGrey'sness thanks to some quieter moments, and plenty of witty exchanges to boot.'' Regarding the Bailey-Mary-Charles sequence the site wrote, ``the action felt so real'', but added, ``But the most intense action was culminating in the OR with Cristina, April and Meredith had a nice moment sitting on the ground together, April sniffling and Meredith stonefaced. Kevin McKidd did some stellar acting as he interacted with them.'' Talking about Meredith's miscarriage he site added, ``She saved Owen, though she did it while having a miscarriage--again, leave it to Grey's to make this the least dramatic, most underplayed storyline of the night. (Brilliantly so.)'' Spoiler Junkie wrote highly of the episode Meredith Grey in particular saying, ``In the most heart-wrenching moment of the entire two-hour season finale, Meredith bursts into the room, asking Clark to kill her. Eye for an eye, she says. She's Lexie's sister. She's like a daughter to Dr. Weber. She's the Chief's wife.'' and noted that, ``This was an amazing season finale, one of the best in the six seasons of Grey's Anatomy. The second hour of the Grey's Anatomy Season 6 season finale, Death and All His Friends, is even more intense than the first.'' HitFix also lauded the episode and wrote, ``In every sense, these two episodes where Shonda Rhimes, directors Stephen Cragg and Rob Corn, and the entire cast and crew of the show ``Going For It''. There was no opportunity for suspense, or tears, or anger, or horror, or some good old-fashioned monologuing left unexplored. Huge stakes, huge emotions, great performances from everybody Chandra Wilson and Sandra Oh were particularly great, as was MichaelO'Neill as shooter Gary Clark. This was about as good as I've ever seen ``Grey's.'' Episodes like these are what I point to when anyone asks me why I'm still watching The site also lauded Ellen Pompeo's character stating, ``Meredith would suffer a miscarriage in the middle of patching up Owen Hunt's bullet wound-and be so hard-core, just as her best friend was next door in risking death to save Meredith's man, that she would just keep working even as blood dripped down her legs. A moment like that works only if everyone involved is 100% committed to the insanity of it, and here everyone was. They all went for it and came up with a riveting two hours of TV. At the completion of the eleventh season Wired named the episode in its must watch list adding, ``The show reaches its dramatic apex in amulti-episode arc about a deadly spree shooter who visits the hospital with a vendetta. The repercussions of this incident will echo through most of Season 7, and well into the future.'' The site also called Pompeo's 'Shoot Me. I'm Your Eye for an Eye. 'the best scene from the entire series.

Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. Cuba has an official area (land area) of109,884 km (42,426 sq mi). Its area is110,860 km (42,800 sq mi) including coastal and territorial waters. The main island (Cuba) has5,746 km (3,570 mi) of coastline and 28.5 km (17.7 mi) of land borders--all figures including the United States territory at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where the U.S. Navy's Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is located. Cuba lies west of the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Gulf of Mexico, south of the Straits of Florida, northwest of the Windward Passage, and northeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. The main island (Cuba) makes up most of the land area104,556 km (40,369 sq mi). The island is1,250 km (780 mi) long and 191 km (119 mi) across its widest points and 31 km (19 mi) across its narrowest points. The largest island outside the main island is the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) in the southwest, with an area of2,200 km (850 sq mi).

Cuba is located 77 km (48 mi) west of Haiti across the Windward Passage, 21 km (13 mi) south of the Bahamas, 150 km (93 mi) south of Florida, 210 km (130 mi) east of Mexico, and 140 km (87 mi) north of Jamaica. Cuba is the largest country by land area in the Caribbean. Its main island is the seventeenth-largest island in the world by land area. The island rises between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. It is bordered on the north by the Straits of Florida, on the northeast by Nicholas Channel and the Old Bahama Channel. The southern part is bounded by the Windward Passage and the Cayman Trench, while the southwest lies in the Caribbean Sea. To the west, it reaches to the Yucat\u00e1n Channel, and the northwest is open to the Gulf of Mexico. More than4,000 islands and cays are found in the surrounding sea and bays. The southern coast includes such archipelagos as Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. The northeastern shore is lined by the Sabana-Camag\u00fcey Archipelago, which includes Jardines del Rey and is composed of approximately2,517 cays and islands. The Colorados Archipelago is developed on the north-western coast. See also: List of islands of Cuba Terrain (edit) Terrain is mostly flat to rolling plains, with rugged hills and mountains in the southeast. The lowest point is the Caribbean Sea at 0 m (sea level) and the highest point is Pico Turquino at1,974 m (6,476 ft), part of the Sierra Maestra mountain range, located in the southeast of the island. Other mountain ranges are Sierra Cristal in the southeast, Escambray Mountains in the center of the island, and Sierra del Rosario in the northwest. White sand beaches (most notably in Varadero), as well as mangroves and marshes can be found in the coastal area. The largest is the Zapata Swamp, with over4,520 km (1,750 sq mi). Cuba has negligible inland water area. The largest natural water mirror is Laguna de Leche at 67.2 km (25.9 sq mi), while the man-made Zaza Reservoir, at 113.5 km (43.8 sq mi), is the largest inland water surface by area in the country. Maritime claims (edit) Cuba makes maritime claims that include a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) and an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles (370.4 km; 230.2 mi).

Natural resources include cobalt, nickel, iron ore, copper, salt, timber, silica, oil and petroleum. At one time, the whole island was covered with forests and there are still many cedar (Cedrela odorata), chechem (Metopium brownei), mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), and other valuable trees. Large areas were cleared to grow more sugarcane, and so few trees remained that timber had to be imported. The most important Cuban mineral economic resource is nickel. Cuba has the second largest nickel reserves in the world after Russia. Sherritt International, a Canadian energy company, operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa, Cuba. Another leading mineral resource is cobalt, a byproduct of nickel mining operations. Cuba ranks as the fifth largest producer of refined cobalt in the world. Petroleum is extracted on Cuba's northern shore, in the provinces of La Habana and Matanzas. Recent petroleum exploration has revealed that the North Cuba Basin could produce approximately 4.6 billion barrels (730,000,000 m) to 9.3 billion barrels (1.48\u00d7 10 m) of petroleum. As of 2006, Cuba has now started to test-drill these locations for possible exploitation. The petroleum is of low quality, and used for energy generation only. Sugarcane was the most important part of the economy in Cuba's history, and is still grown on large areas. Extensive irrigation systems are developed in the south of Sancti Sp\u00edritus Province. Tobacco, used for some of the world's cigars, is grown especially in the Pinar del R\u00edo Province.

Cuba is the principal island, which is surrounded by four main groups of islands. These are the Colorados, the Sabana-Camag\u00fcey, the Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. The main island of Cuba constitutes most of the nation's land area or104,556 km (40,369 sq mi) and is the seventeenth-largest island in the world by land area. The second largest island in Cuba is the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) in the southwest, with an area of2,200 km (850 sq mi). Cuba has a total land area of109,884 km (42,426 sq mi). The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains. At the southeastern end is the Sierra Maestra, a range of steep mountains whose highest point is the Pico Real del Turquino at1,974 metres (6,476 ft). The climate is tropical, though moderated by trade winds. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is 23.1\u00b0 C (73.6\u00b0 F) in January and 27\u00b0 C (80.6\u00b0 F) in July. Cuba lies in the path of hurricanes, and these destructive storms are most common in September and October. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camag\u00fcey. Better known smaller towns include Baracoa which was the first Spanish settlement on Cuba, Trinidad, a UNESCO world heritage site, and Bayamo. Administrative subdivisions (edit) Main article: Provinces of Cuba Level-3 administrative divisions in Cuba. Cuba is divided into 15 Provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). The provinces are further subdivided into level 3 subdivisions, called municipalities (Spanish: Municipios), of which there are 168 following the 2010 administrative redistribution.

For other uses, see Cycle. Social cycle theories are among the earliest social theories in sociology. Unlike the theory of social evolutionism, which views the evolution of society and human history as progressing in some new, unique direction (s), sociological cycle theory argues that events and stages of society and history are generally repeating themselves in cycles. Such a theory does not necessarily imply that there can not be any social progress. In the early theory of Sima Qian and the more recent theories of long-term (``secular'') political-demographic cycles as well as in the Varnic theory of P.R. Sarkar an explicit accounting is made of social progress. Contents (hide) 1 Historical forerunners 2 19th and 20th century theories 3 Contemporary theories 4 See also 5 References 6 Further reading 7 External links Historical forerunners (edit) Interpretation of history as repeating cycles of Dark and Golden Ages was a common belief among ancient cultures. The more limited cyclical view of history defined as repeating cycles of events was put forward in the academic world in the 19th century in historiosophy (a branch of historiography) and is a concept that falls under the category of sociology. However, Polybius, Ibn Khaldun (see Asabiyyah), and Giambattista Vico can be seen as precursors of this analysis. The Saeculum was identified in Roman times. In recent times, P.R. Sarkar in his Social Cycle Theory has used this idea to elaborate his interpretation of history. 19th and 20th century theories (edit) Among the prominent historiosophers, Russian philosopher Nikolai Danilewski (1822--1885) is important. In Rossiia i Evropa (1869) he differentiated between various smaller civilizations (Egyptian, Chinese, Persian, Greek, Roman, German, and Slav, among others). He wrote that each civilization has a life cycle, and by the end of the 19th century the Roman-German civilization was in decline, while the Slav civilization was approaching its Golden Age. A similar theory was put forward by Oswald Spengler (1880--1936) who in his Der Untergang des Abendlandes (1918) also argued that the Western civilization had entered its final phase of development and its decline was inevitable. The first social cycle theory in sociology was created by Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848--1923) in his Trattato di Sociologia Generale (1916). He centered his theory on the concept of an elite social class, which he divided into cunning 'foxes 'and violent 'lions '. In his view of society, the power constantly passes from the 'foxes 'to the 'lions 'and vice versa. Sociological cycle theory was also developed by Pitirim A. Sorokin (1889--1968) in his Social and Cultural Dynamics (1937, 1943). He classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality ', which can be ideational (reality is spiritual), sensate (reality is material), or idealistic (a synthesis of the two). He interpreted the contemporary West as a sensate civilization dedicated to technological progress and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era. Alexandre Deulofeu (1903--1978) developed a mathematical model of social cycles that he claimed fit historical facts. He argued that civilizations and empires go through cycles in his book Mathematics of History (in Catalan, published in 1951). He claims that each civilization passes through a minimum of three 1700-year cycles. As part of civilizations, empires have an average lifespan of 550 years. He also stated that by knowing the nature of these cycles, it could be possible to modify the cycles in such a way that change could be peaceful instead of leading to war. Deulofeu believed he had found the origin of Romanesque art, during the 9th century, in an area between Empord\u00e0 and Roussillon, which he argued was the cradle of the second cycle of western European civilization. Contemporary theories (edit) One of the most important recent findings in the study of the long-term dynamic social processes was the discovery of the political-demographic cycles as a basic feature of the dynamics of complex agrarian systems. The presence of political-demographic cycles in thepre-modern history of Europe and China, and in chiefdom level societies worldwide has been known for quite a long time, and already in the 1980s more or less developed mathematical models of demographic cycles started to be produced (first of all for Chinese ``dynastic cycles'') (Usher 1989). At the moment we have a considerable number of such models (Chu and Lee 1994; Nefedov 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004; S. Malkov, Kovalev, and A. Malkov 2000; S. Malkov and A. Malkov 2000; Malkov and Sergeev 2002, 2004a, 2004b; Malkov et al. 2002; Malkov 2002, 2003, 2004; Turchin 2003, 2005a; Korotayev et al. 2006). Recently the most important contributions to the development of the mathematical models of long-term (``secular'') sociodemographic cycles have been made by Sergey Nefedov, Peter Turchin, Andrey Korotayev, and Sergey Malkov. What is important is that on the basis of their models Nefedov, Turchin and Malkov have managed to demonstrate that sociodemographic cycles were a basic feature of complex agrarian systems (and not a specifically Chinese or European phenomenon). The basic logic of these models is as follows: After the population reaches the ceiling of the carrying capacity of land, its growth rate declines toward near-zero values. The system experiences significant stress with decline in the living standards of the common population, increasing the severity of famines, growing rebellions etc. As has been shown by Nefedov, most complex agrarian systems had considerable reserves for stability, however, within 50--150 years these reserves were usually exhausted and the system experienced a demographic collapse (a Malthusian catastrophe), when increasingly severe famines, epidemics, increasing internal warfare and other disasters led to a considerable decline of population. As a result of this collapse, free resources became available, per capita production and consumption considerably increased, the population growth resumed and a new sociodemographic cycle started. It has become possible to model these dynamics mathematically in a rather effective way. Note that the modern theories of political-demographic cycles do not deny the presence of trend dynamics and attempt at the study of the interaction between cyclical and trend components of historical dynamics. Modern social scientists from different fields have introduced cycle theories to predict civilizational collapses in approaches that apply contemporary methods that update the approach of Spengler, such as the work of Joseph Tainter suggesting a civilizational life-cycle. In moremicro-studies that follow the work of Malthus, scholars such as David Lempert have presented ``alpha-helix'' models of population, economics, and political response, including violence, in cyclical forms that add aspects of culture change into the model. Lempert has also modeled political violence in Russian society, suggesting that theories attributing violence in Russia to ideologies are less useful than cyclical models of population and economic productivity.

This academic band, including Wilson's closest adviser and long-time friend ``Colonel'' Edward M. House, as well as Walter Lippmann, met to assemble the strategy for the postwar world. The team produced more than2,000 documents detailing and analyzing the political, economic, and social facts globally that would be helpful for Wilson in the peace talks. Their reports formed the basis for the Fourteen Points, which outlined Wilson's strategy for peace after war's end. These scholars then traveled to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and participated in the discussions there. As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called ``The Institute of International Affairs'', which would have offices in London and New York. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings that had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name Council on Foreign Relations. The meetings were headed by the corporate lawyer Elihu Root, who had served as Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt, and attended by 108 ``high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers.'' The members were proponents of Wilson's internationalism, but were particularly concerned about ``the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business.'' The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity here to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to engineer government policy. On July 29, 1921 they filed a certification of incorporation, officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations. In 1922 Edwin F. Gay, former dean of the Harvard Business School and director of the Shipping Board during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the ``authoritative'' source on foreign policy. He gathered$125,000 from the wealthy members on the council, and via sending letters soliciting funds to ``the thousand richest Americans''. Using these funds, the first issue of Foreign Affairs was published in September 1922, and within a few years had a gained a reputation as the ``most authoritative American review dealing with international relations''. (T) he common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality. ``'' Former CFR board member Walter Lippman, Public Opinion (1922) In the late 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began contributing large amounts of money to the Council. In 1938 they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., throughout the country, funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council's policies, while also acting as ``useful listening posts'' through which the Council and U.S. government could ``sense the mood of the country''. Beginning in 1939 and lasting for five years, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the State Department, when it established the strictly confidential War and Peace Studies, funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The secrecy surrounding this group was such, that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence. It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial, security and armaments, territorial, and political. The security and armaments group was headed by Allen Welsh Dulles who later became a pivotal figure in the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services. The CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, marked classified and circulated among the appropriate government departments. Cold War era, 1945 to 1979 (edit) David Rockefeller (1915--2017), joined the Council in 1941 and was appointed as a director in 1949 A critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council. During the Eisenhower administration 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under Truman, 42% of the top posts were filled by council members. During the Kennedy administration, this number rose to 51%, and peaked at 57% under the Johnson administration. In an anonymous piece called ``The Sources of Soviet Conduct'' that appeared in Foreign Affairs in 1947, CFR study group member George Kennan coined the term ``containment''. The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. William Bundy credited the CFR's study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the Marshall Plan and NATO. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards1,000. CFR Headquarters, located in the former Harold Pratt House in New York City Dwight D. Eisenhower chaired a CFR study group while he served as President of Columbia University. One member later said, ``whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings.'' The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called ``Americans for Eisenhower'' to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Dulles gave a public address at the Harold Pratt House in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower's foreign policy: ``There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.'' After this speech, the council convened a session on ``Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy'' and chose Henry Kissinger to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists. On November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between France and Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh forces, a struggle that would later become known as the First Indochina War. Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily nationalist in nature and that Marxism had ``little to do with the current revolution.'' Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied withanti-Communist South Vietnam and against Ho and his supporters in the Vietnam War. The Council served as a ``breeding ground'' for important American policies such as mutual deterrence, arms control, and nuclearnon-proliferation. In 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers. A four-year-long study of relations between America and China was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. Henry Kissinger had continued to publish in Foreign Affairs and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as National Security Adviser in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by President Carter's Secretary of State, another Council member, Cyrus Vance. Vietnam created a rift within the organization. When Hamilton Fish Armstrong announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of Foreign Affairs after 45 years, new chairman David Rockefeller approached a family friend, William Bundy, to take over the position.Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy's hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a war criminal for his prior actions. In November 1979, while chairman of the CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the US for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from The New York Times) for the first time in his public life. In his book White House Diary, Carter wrote of the affair, ``April 9 (1979) David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce me to let the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and Brzezinski seem to be adopting this as a joint project...'' Current status (edit) Mission (edit) Network diagram showing interlocks between various U.S. corporations and institutions and the Council on Foreign Relations, in 2004 As stated on its website, the CFR's mission is to be ``a resource for its members, government officials, business executives, journalists, educators and students, civic and religious leaders, and other interested citizens in order to help them better understand the world and the foreign policy choices facing the United States and other countries''. It convenes meetings at which government officials, global leaders and prominent members of the foreign policy community discuss major international issues. Its think tank, the David Rockefeller Studies Program, is composed of about fifty adjunct and full-time scholars, as well as ten in-residence recipients of year-long fellowships, who cover the major regions and significant issues shaping today's international agenda. These scholars contribute to the foreign policy debate by making recommendations to the presidential administration, testifying before Congress, serving as a resource to the diplomatic community, interacting with the media, authoring books, reports, articles, and op-eds on foreign policy issues. President Richard N. Haass In the context of critical theory on global capitalism, some social scientists name the CFR prominently among an array of elite planning, or policy-making organizations, such as the Trilateral Commission, Hood and Bell, and the Business Roundtable, that they see as working together with other powerful entities across capitalist society in pursuit of common interests. Political scientist William Aviles, for example, includes the CFR among a class of ``transnational policy-making institutions'' that he contends have worked in tandem with Western governments and international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to ``expand free trade, reduce regulations upon the investments of transnational corporations, and accelerate the integration of markets through economic blocs (such as the North American Free Trade Association or the European Union).''

Bush addresses a meeting of CFR, December 2005 The CFR started a program in 2008 to last for 5 years and funded by a grant from the Robina Foundation called ``International Institutions and Global Governance'' which aims to identify the institutional requirements for effective multilateral cooperation in the 21st century. The CFR's Maurice C. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies, directed by scholar and author Sebastian Mallaby, works to promote a better understanding among policymakers, academic specialists, and the interested public of how economic and political forces interact to influence world affairs. The CFR's Center for Preventive Action (CPA) seeks to help prevent, defuse, or resolve deadly conflicts around the world and to expand the body of knowledge on conflict prevention. It does so by creating a forum in which representatives of governments, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and civil society can gather to develop operational and timely strategies for promoting peace in specific conflict situations. Foreign Affairs (edit) The council publishes Foreign Affairs, ``the preeminent journal of international affairs and U.S. foreign policy''. It also establishes independent task forces, which bring together experts with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work together to produce reports offering both findings and policy prescriptions on important foreign policy topics. The CFR has sponsored more than fifty reports, including the Independent Task Force on the Future of North America that published report No, 53, titled Building a North American Community, in May 2005. Media opinions (edit) In 2005, Inter Press Service News Agency described CFR as ``the nation's most influential foreign-policy think tank''. The council received a three star rating (out of a possible four stars) from Charity Navigator in fiscal year 2016, as measured by their analysis of the council's financial data and ``accountability and transparency''. Controversy (edit) The council has been the subject of debates over sovereignty as well as the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. This is primarily due to the number of high-ranking government officials (along with world business leaders and prominent media figures) in its membership and the large number of aspects of American foreign policy that its members have been involved with. Echoing the most common accusation, the paleoconservative John Birch Society claims that the CFR is ``Guilty of conspiring with others to build a one world government...'' Other figures, including conservative author and faith-based political theorist W. Cleon Skousen, have opposed the CFR vociferously.

Set in the Star Wars universe, the attraction sent guests on a excursion trip to Endor, whilst being caught in an altercation between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. The attraction featured Captain ``Rex'' RX-24 along with series regulars R2-D2 and C-3PO. At its debut at Disneyland in 1987, it was the first attraction based originally on anon-Disney licensed intellectual property. The first incarnation of the ride appeared in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in 1987, replacing the previous attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space. The attraction had subsequent openings at Tokyo Disneyland, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disneyland Paris. The attraction at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios closed in 2010 to allow conversion for its successor attraction, Star Tours--The Adventures Continue. The latter location was completed on May 20, 2011. Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris closed their versions for conversion in 2012 and 2016, marking the original ride's final run of 29 years.

It would have been an interactive ride-simulator attraction where guests would have had the ability to choose the route. However, after preliminary planning the Black Hole attraction was shelved due to its enormous cost--approximately$50 million USD--as well as the unpopularity of the film itself. Instead of completely dismissing the idea of a simulator, the company decided to make use of a partnership between Disney and George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, that began in 1986 with the opening of Captain EO (a 3-D musical film starring Michael Jackson) at the California park. Disney then approached Lucas with the idea for Star Tours. With Lucas 'approval, Disney Imagineers purchased four military-grade flight simulators at a cost of$500,000 each and designed the ride structure. Meanwhile, Lucas and his team of special effects technicians at Industrial Light& Magic produced the first-person perspective film that would be projected inside the simulators. When both simulator and film were completed, a programmer then sat inside and used a joystick to synchronize the movement of the simulator with the apparent movement on screen. On January 9, 1987, at a final cost of$32 million, almost twice the cost of building the entire park in 1955, the ride opened to throngs of patrons, many of whom dressed up as Star Wars characters for the occasion. In celebration, Disneyland remained open for a 60-hour marathon from January 9 at 10 a.m. to January 11 at 10 p.m. Closing (edit) On August 14, 2010, Walt Disney World hosted the ``Last Tour To Endor'' event exclusively for Celebration V attendees at Disney's Hollywood Studios from 8pm to 1am. Entertainment features and events at ``Last Tour To Endor'' included George Lucas, character appearances, Jedi Training Academy, Death Star Disco, Bespin Stage Dance Party, Raiders Of The Lost Jedi Temple of Doom: A Fan Film of Epic Proportions live show, Hyperspace Hoopla, Symphony in the Stars fireworks, and the Star Tours shutdown ceremony. The Star Tours shutdown ceremony was a live show with characters C-3PO, R2-D2, Boba Fett, Darth Vader and a few Stormtroopers, culminating in the official power-down of the original Disney World Star Tours attraction. However, instead of R2-D2 simply shutting it down, Boba Fett destroyed the ride's power supply using a thermal detonator (achieved using pyrotechnics). The ride was still open after the shutdown ceremony until September 7, 2010, when the attraction held its ``Final Flight to Endor'' exclusive to D23 members. Attraction (edit) Attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios Advertised as ``The Ultimate Star Wars Adventure!'', Star Tours put the guest in the role of a space tourist en route to the forest moon of Endor, the site of the climactic battle of Return of the Jedi, via the Star Tours travel agency. Much was made of this throughout the ride queue, which was designed to look like a spaceship boarding terminal: posters advertised voyages to different planets, and a giant screen informed riders of the benefits of going to Endor. This area was stocked with Audio-Animatronic characters that seemed to speak to the ride patrons (including C-3PO and R2-D2), as well as a life-size mock-up of a StarSpeeder 3000, the fictional spacecraft which riders were about to board. According to the book Disneyland Detective by Kendra Trahan, the figures of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the Disneyland attraction were actual props from the original film, modified to operate via Audio-Animatronics. Guests then entered a maintenance area where an apparently underproductive G2 droid performed repairs on another droid while being distracted by the observing guests, and another droid inadvertently pointed out all the supposed flaws of the StarSpeeder 3000 and its RX pilots. The G2 droids were in fact the animatronic skeletons of two geese from the Tomorrowland attraction America Sings. A ride attendant escorted guests to one of several loading stations where they waited for their turn to ride. A television screen above the queue displayed a countdown to take-off time and showed images of the Starspeeder 3000 spacecraft being serviced. As launch time approached, a safety video was shown featuring Star Wars aliens, Disney Imagineers, and their families. It instructed guests how to fasten their seat belts and where to place belongings. Once the doors to the Starspeeder opened, guests walked across bridges into one of several Starspeeder cabins. As the doors closed, the bumbling pilot droid of the ship, RX-24 or Rex (voiced by Paul Reubens), appeared on the side screen and chatted to the guests about the trip as R2-D2 was loaded onto the spacecraft. Rex lowered the cockpit shield, and the hangar crew activated the flight platform. All went well until a slight mistake on Captain Rex's part sent the Starspeeder crashing into the maintenance bay doors and plummeting into the maintenance yard. They just barely crashed into the control room and nearly collided with a giant mechanical arm. Once in space, Rex asked R2-D2 to make the jump to lightspeed. However, the ship accidentally passed the Endor moon and instead got caught inside a comet cluster. The ship got hit by several comets before getting trapped in one of the larger comets. The Starspeeder weaved its way through the comet and escaped by crashing through one of the walls. Upon escaping the comet, however, the ship encountered a Star Destroyer of the Imperial Remnant. The Starspeeder got caught in its tractor beam, but managed to get loose when a New RepublicX-wing fighter provided assistance by destroying the tractor beam's generator. Soon the Starspeeder accompanied the Republic fleet on an assault on the Death Star III (later revealed by Leland Chee in 2013 to be a Habitation Sphere disguised as a Death Star in a plot by an Imperial Warlord to distract the New Republic). Rex used the Starspeeder's lasers to eliminate several TIE fighters while a Republic pilot destroyed the Death Star in the same manner as Luke Skywalker by firing two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port. TheX-Wings jumped to lightspeed as the Death Star exploded, and a final lightspeed jump sent the Starspeeder back to the spaceport, nearly colliding with a fuel truck in the hangar and sending a Star Tours employee ducking under his desk. As the cockpit shield raised and cut off Rex as he apologized for the near-fatal flight, C-3PO instructed the passengers on the exit procedure and thanked them, oblivious to the perils they just faced. The exit doors opposite the entrance then opened and the passengers proceeded across another set of bridges into the exit hall towards the Star Trader gift shop.

One year earlier, Reubens had voiced the shipboard computer in the Disney film Flight of the Navigator (credited as Paul Mall), in which his character was named Max. Reubens credited this role with his being cast for the ride. Ride system (edit) Star Tours utilized hydraulic motion base cabins featuring six degrees of freedom, including the ability to move 35 degrees in theX-Y-Z plane. The simulator was patented as Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator (ATLAS), originally designed by Rediffusion Simulation in Sussex, England, now owned by Thales Training& Simulation (ex-Thomson-CSF). The Rediffusion 'Leisure 'simulator was originally developed for a much simpler show in Canada called ``Tour of the Universe'', where it featured a single entrance/ exit door in the rear of the cabin and a video projector. The film was front-projected onto the screen from a 70 mm film projector located beneath the cockpit barrier. The Disneyland original had four simulators, while the shows in Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and WDW Disney's Hollywood Studio each had six motion bases. Successor (edit) Main article: Star Tours--The Adventures Continue The successor attraction opened in Disney's Hollywood Studios on May 20, 2011 and at Disneyland on June 3, 2011, replacing the parks 'original Star Tours attractions. It features an updated ride system, consisting of a new high-definition video, a Dolby 3D high-definition screen, improved motion simulators and several new special effects and Audio-animatronics. The attraction is set at an earlier point in the Star Wars timeline (between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope) and is piloted by C-3PO. Gallery (edit) An Audio-animatronic Mon Calamari can be seen in the control booth Queue showing Star Speeder.

The hotel has been housed in two historic landmark buildings in New York. The first, bearing the same name, was built in two stages, as the Waldorf Hotel and the Astoria Hotel, which accounts for its dual name. That original site was situated on Astor family properties along Fifth Avenue, opened in 1893, and designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. The present building, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, is a 47-story 190.5 m (625 ft) Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver, which was completed in 1931. The current hotel was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963, when it was surpassed by Moscow's Hotel Ukraina by 7 metres (23 ft). An icon of glamour and luxury, the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels. Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high-end properties around the world now operate under the name, including in New York City. From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a$150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017. The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had1,416 rooms, the main hotel had1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as The Cole Porter Suite, The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine, a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston, is the home of the Rob Roy and the Bobbie Burns cocktails.

The hotel was originally known as The Waldorf-Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, ``Meet Me at the Hyphen.'' The sign was changed to a double hyphen, looking similar to an equals sign, by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949. The double hyphen visually represents ``Peacock Alley'', the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels& Resorts chain. The hotel has since been known as the Waldorf Astoria New York, without any hyphen, though this is sometimes shortened to the Waldorf Astoria. History (edit) Engraved vignettes of the original separate hotels Original buildings (edit) Main article: Waldorf--Astoria (New York, 1893) The original hotel started as two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood 225 feet (69 m) high, with a frontage of about 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, with an area of69,475 square feet (6,454.4 m). The original hotel was described as having a ``lofty stone and brick exterior'', which was ``animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets''. William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as ``Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming'', resembling ``a typical German professor with his close-cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord''. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed. At first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was originally a laughing stock with its high number of bathrooms and was known briefly as ``Boldt's Folly'' or ``Astor's Folly'', with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. It soon became a major success, earning$4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period. William Waldorf Astor Oscar Tschirky William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt's assistance, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect the two buildings, and the hotel subsequently became known as the ``Waldorf-Astoria'', the largest hotel in the world at the time. With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent ``wealthy upper crust'' of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, ``a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family''. It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was ``the guest is always right'', became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as ``Oscar of the Waldorf'', ma\u00eetred'h\u00f4tel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who ``composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees''. In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria. The original hotel's Octagon Room, 1893 The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some$250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time the hotel had$7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902 a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909 banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month. The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C.. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith (Republican, Michigan) as chair, Jonathan Bourne (Republican, Oregon), Theodore E. Burton (Republican, Ohio), Duncan U. Fletcher (Democrat, Florida), Francis G. Newlands (Democrat, Nevada), George Clement Perkins (Republican, California), and Furnifold McLendel Simmons (Democrat, North Carolina). The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate and liberal wings of the two parties. Banquet for Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel (1909) US Senate Committee hearing for the sinking of the RMS Titanic (1912) Women operating stock market board and a ticker tape machine at the Waldorf in 1918, during World War I. In 1919, restaurateur Louis Sherry announced an ``alliance'' with the Waldorf-Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services. Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in ``Boomer-duPont interests'', a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf-Astoria, and T. Coleman du Pont. Upon his death that year, William Waldorf Astor was reputed to have been worth\u00a3 200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth\u00a3 10 million. On the evening of November 15, 1926, the National Broadcasting Company broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria. Among the entertainers heard by radio listeners was Will Rogers. The network became the Red Network on January 1, 1927 when NBC launched its second network, designated the Blue Network. An antitrust suit forced the sale of the Blue Network in 1942; it became the American Broadcasting Company. The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor (1904), The St. Regis (1904), The Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after. Current building (edit) Early years and International politics (edit) The idea of a new Waldorf-Astoria hotel was based on the concept that there should be a large opulent hotel in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised$10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate. The new building opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one third of which were leased as private residences. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: ``The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality... marks the measure of nation's growth in power, in comfort and in artistry... an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation''. There were2,000 people in the ballroom listening to this speech, but by the end of the business day, the2,200-room hotel had only 500 occupancies. It was not until 1939 that the Waldorf-Astoria began operating at a profit. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure who Tony Rey referred to as ``the greatest hotelman of his era''. Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf-Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947. Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as ``comparable to great national institutions'' and a ``living symbol deep within our collective consciousness''. It had the ``greatest banquet department in the world'' at the time according to restaurateur Tom Margittai, with the centre of activity being the Grand Ballroom. On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the ``cream of New York's literary world'' attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor Pearl S. Buck, the author of The Good Earth, which was the best-selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932. One dinner alone, a relatively ``small dinner'' attended by some 50 people in June 1946, raised over$250,000. The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging Cold War and international relations during thepost-war years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, Winston Churchill attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor Thomas E. Dewey, ten days after making his famous Iron Curtain speech, and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the Big Four Conference was held in J\u00f8rgine Boomer's apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers between the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union to discuss the future of Eastern Europe. On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the Hollywood film industry, including various film executives such as Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures, Spyros Skouras of 20th Century Fox and Albert Warner of Warner Bros. and Eric Johnston, the head of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the Waldorf Statement, banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry. The Statement was a response to the contempt of Congress charges against the so-called ``Hollywood Ten''. On June 21, 1948 a press conference at the hotel introduced the LP record. From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging Cold War and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference came at time when there was deepanti-Communist sentiment and suspicion of the Soviet Union in the United States, following the Berlin Blockade and the Czechoslovak coupd'\u00e9tat the previous year. The event was organized by the struggling American Communist Party, but was sponsored by many individuals who were not Stalinists such as Leonard Bernstein, Marlon Brando, Albert Einstein and Aaron Copland, with the intention of promoting peace. The conference was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich and writer Alexsander Fadeyev. Tension mounted during the controversial event, and culminated when Shostakovich, in front of a crowd of some 800 people, launched a scathing attack on western civilization, remarking that ``a small clique of hatemongers was preparing world public opinion for the transition from cold war to outright aggression''. The event was picketed in acounter-attack byanti-Stalinists running under the banner of ``America for Intellectual Freedom'' (AIF), and prominent individuals such as Irving Howe, Dwight Macdonald, Mary McCarthy, Robert Lowell and Norman Mailer publicly denounced Stalinism at the hotel. In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist Yigael Yadin met secretly with the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Mar Samuel in the basement of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel. The scrolls were kept in a vault at the Waldorf-Astoria branch of New York's Chemical Bank. At the request of the Israeli government, respected biblical scholar Dr. Harry Orlinsky examined the scrolls and verified their authenticity; Yadin paid$250,000 for all four. Restaurateur George Lang began working at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1955, and on December 13, 1955 he helped organize the American Theatre Wing's First Night Ball to celebrate Helen Hayes's 50th year in show business. He did much to organize dinners at the Waldorf to assist Hungarian issues and relief. On one occasion an event was attended by the likes of Edward G. Robinson and pianist Doklady and some$60,000 was raised. April in Paris Ball (edit) Main article: April in Paris Ball Marilyn Monroe with organizer Elsa Maxwell at the 1957 April in Paris Ball The April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Franco--American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because ``Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring he would make it in October''. After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues. The ball was designed to cater for ``very, very high-class people'' according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a Chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi-Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags and a pedigree poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes were given out. Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from tax, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people were paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated ``We charge the most, give the most, and make the most--it's a success formula''. Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer. Marlene Dietrich at the April in Paris Ball in 1959 The Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a ``three-hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by Stuart Chaney'', (depicting) a twelfth century scene of troubadours at the court of Eleanor of Aquitane, Henry VIII's meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Louis XIV at Versailles, and a fashion show of forty creations by Dior, Fath, Balmain, Desses and Givenchy ``. French stars Juliette Greco, Jean Sablon, Beatrice Lillie, John Loder and many others were flown over for the ball. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Senator John F. Kennedy, his wife, Jackie, and Marilyn Monroe, who paid$100 each and donated$130,000 to charities. The following year, the ballroom was decorated with 30 feet (9.1 m) high chestnut trees, earning US$170,000 for charities. The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century. Genuine circus costumes from the period were flown over from France, and the ball was attended by Marlene Dietrich, who performed two Maurice Chevalier songs, wearing a top hat, trousers, a waistcoat and white gloves. Later History (edit) On May 6, 1963, Time magazine celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event was attended by some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others. In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with the staff of the Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash up front. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at Waldorf on January 17, 1990. Conrad Hilton Soon after the opening of the hotel in 1931, hotelier Conrad Hilton, almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, ``The Greatest of Them All''. He acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949. The Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a ``20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests'' brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Waldorf was on red alert, and German Shepherd sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. 15 suites of the hotel were reserved for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Arab delegation. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted Vice President, and a 90-minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO leader Yasser Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria, and in 1985, the NBA held its first-ever draft lottery betweennon-playoff teams at the Starlight Room. The lottery was for the 1985 NBA Draft in which Patrick Ewing was the consensus number one pick. Lee Jablin, of Harman Jablin Architects, fully renovated and upgraded the historical property to its original grandeur during themid-1980s through themid-1990s in a$150 million renovation. The hotel was named an official New York City Landmark in 1993. On May 27, 2001, the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America had a grand banquet at the hotel to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia's conversion to Christianity, with Ambassador Edward Djerejian as guest speaker. On May 7, 2004, a press conference was held by MGM, discussing Steve Martin's The Pink Panther of The Pink Panther. The 5th Annual DGA Honors Gala was held at the Waldorf on September 29. In 2006, Hilton launched Waldorf Astoria Hotels& Resorts, a global luxury brand named for the iconic hotel. There are now branches of the Waldorf Astoria in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana in the United States, and abroad in France, Israel, Italy and Saudi Arabia. In 2006 it was reported that Hilton were considering opening a new Waldorf Astoria hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008 the Waldorf Astoria opened the Guerlain and Spa Chakra, Inc. spa at the hotel, as part of the Waldorf Astoria Collection, which offers a ``body massage and facial using Guerlain's age-defying Orchidee Imperiale skincare''. The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria'' continues to operate as a boutique ``hotel within a hotel''. In October 2014, it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with the remainder of the rooms remaining hotel suites. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017, with plans to reopen it in 2020. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La Chine, closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from any alteration during the renovations. Architecture (edit) Old buildings (edit) Main article: Waldorf--Astoria (New York, 1893)\u00a7 Architecture Gentlemen's Cafe Restaurant Henry IV drawing room Louis XIV bedroom The old Waldorf Hotel, built at a reported cost of about US$5 million, opened on March 13, 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had previously built his mansion. The hotel stood 225 feet (69 m) high, about 50 feet (15 m) lower than the Astoria, with a frontage of about 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, and a total area of69,475 square feet (6,454.4 m). It was a German Renaissance structure, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, with 15 public rooms and 450 guest rooms, and a further 100 rooms allocated to servants, with laundry facilities on the upper floors. The New York Times proclaimed the hotel a palace after it opened in 1893. The exterior featured loggias, balconies, gables, groups of chimneys, and tiled roofs. One of the chief features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which was used as a reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits. Main ballroom as theater Astoria restaurant. Fifth Avenue corner suite drawing room Astoria double bedroom The old Astoria Hotel, opened in 1897, was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh. With dimensions of 99 by 350 feet (30 m\u00d7 107 m), its height, from the floor of thesub-basement, which was 33 feet (10 m) below the street level, to the roof-line, was about 270 feet (82 m), or about 240 feet (73 m) above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the four stories in the roof. The building was constructed of stone, marble and brick, with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction, and was embellished with ``French Second Empire Mansard-roofed towers with iron-work cresting as well as Austrian Baroque onion-domes over corners turrets''. There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms, with miles of corridors, vestibules and balls. The main corridor ran the entire length of the building from east to west. To the left of it was the Astor Dining Room, fronting on Fifth Avenue, which measured 50 by 92 feet (15 m\u00d7 28 m). Great care was taken with it to faithfully reproduce the original dining room of the mansion, three floors above where it had stood, with all of the original paneling, carpeting, drapery and fireplace mantel and Italian Renaissance pilasters and columns, carved of marble from northern Russia. On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, decorated in the Italian style, 88 by 57 feet (27 m\u00d7 17 m). On the first floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, 87 by 102 feet (27 m\u00d7 31 m), looking out on 34th Street, finished in the style of the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids 'bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. The ballroom, in the Louis XIV style, has been described as the ``pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance'' of the hotel, measuring 65 feet (20 m) by 95 feet (29 m) and 40 feet (12 m) (three stories) in height. It had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and1,200 at concerts, and featured tints of ivory-gray and cream in its design. On the hotel's top floor was the roof-garden, enclosed on all sides by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric. Current building (edit) Exterior (edit) Waldorf Astoria, Park Avenue facade Travel America stated: ``To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s, when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth.'' The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed by building atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, with buildings like the Waldorf Astoria utilizing ``air rights'' to the space above the tracks. The new building opened on October 1, 1931. The 47-story 190.5 m (625 ft) hotel was the tallest and largest hotel in the world, and remained so for a number of years.1,585 cubic feet (44.9 m) of black marble was imported from Belgium, 600 cubic feet (17 m) of Brech Montalto and 260 cubic feet (7.4 m) of Alps Green arrived from Italy, and some 300 antique mantles were brought in to furnish it. 200 railroad cars brought some800,000 cubic feet (23,000 m) of limestone for the building's facing,27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and2,595,000 square feet (241,100 m) of terra cotta and gypsum block. The towers are brick-faced, which led many to believe that the builders ran out of money. Peacock Alley, a 300 feet (91 m) long corridor lined with amber marble connects the two hotel buildings. Gilded, women of the times would enjoy walking along it and admiring themselves in the mirrors. In 1931 it was reported that as many as36,000 people were walking down it on any given day. The Peacock Alley restaurant of the Waldorf took its name from the alley. The hotel had its own railway platform, Track 61, that was part of the New York City Subway and was connected to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public. Interior (edit) Above: The main registration lobby. Below: The foyer Such is the architectural and cultural heritage of the hotel that tours are conducted of the hotel for guests. Frommer's has cited the hotel as an ``icon of luxury'', and highlights the ``wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white-gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade'', the ``stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier'' and the ``free-standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures'' in the main lobby. They compare the decor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush-carpeted which ``seem to go on forever''. The lobby floor contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth's Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry's Bar. From 1992 to 2013, Kenneth, sometimes called the world's first celebrity hairdresser, famed for creating Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant in 1961, moved his hairdressing and beauty salon to the Waldorf after a 1990 fire destroyed his East 54th Street shop. In the main foyer is a chandelier measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m). The elevator is furnished with paneled pollard oak and Carpathian elm. Special desks in the lobby are allocated to transportation and theatre, where exclusive tickets to many of the city's prominent theatres can be purchased. The lobby is furnished with polished nickel-bronze cornices and rockwood stone. The grand clock, a4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) bronze was built by the Goldsmith's Company of London originally for the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago, but was purchased by the Waldorf owners. Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland, and Queen Victoria and Benjamin Franklin. A shield once belonging to the Waldorf was moved to the Alexis restaurant on W. Franklin Street in 1984. Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter's Steinway& Sons floral print decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, George M. Cohan and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel. Left: The elevator lobby. Right: The Park Avenue lobby. The third floor contains the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet was held at the Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affairco-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the Enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, ``I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that I leave my dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time''. Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the ``Starlight Roof''. Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vert\u00e8s, Louis XVI and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday night card games were played. There is also are-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Rooms and suites (edit) Waldorf Towers suite 30A The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had1,416 rooms, the main hotel had1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, 17 of which were classified as ``Astoria Level'', which are upgraded rooms with deluxe amenities and complimentary access to the Astoria Lounge. The Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. As of the late 1990s, the hotel had a housekeeping staff of nearly 400, with 150-day maids and two dozen night maids. The rooms retain the original Art Deco motifs, although each room is decorated differently. The guests rooms, classified as Deluxe, Superior, and Luxury, feature ``Waldorf Serenity'' beds and have a marble bath or shower with amenities designed by Salvatore Ferragamo. The suites featured King or Double beds and start in size at 450 square feet (42 m). The smallest are the One Bedroom suites, which range from 450 square feet (42 m) to 600 square feet (56 m), then there are the Signature suites, with a separate living room and one or two bedrooms, which range from 750 square feet (70 m) to 900 square feet (84 m), and finally the suites of The Towers which are generally larger and costlier still, and have a twice-daily maid service. The Tower suites are divided into standard ones, The Towers Luxury Series, which have their own sitting room, the Towers Penthouse Series, the Towers Presidential-Style Suites, and finally the most expensive Presidential Suite on the 35th floor. The Penthouse Series contains three suites, The Penthouse, The Cole Porter Suite, and The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They start at1,800 square feet (170 m) in size, with two or more bedrooms, and are fitted with a kitchen and dining room which can accommodate for 8-12 guests. The Towers Presidential-Style Suites are divided into the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite, and have their own grand entry foyer. Like the Penthouse Series, they have their own kitchen and dining room. The2,250 square feet (209 m) Presidential Suite is designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It has three large bedrooms and three bathrooms, and boasts numerous treasures, including the desk of General MacArthur and rocking chair of John F. Kennedy. Other facilities (edit) A2,500 square feet (230 m) fitness center is on the 5th floor. The$21.5 million Waldorf Astoria Guerlain Spa was inaugurated on September 1, 2008 on the 19th floor. It features 16 treatment rooms and two relaxation lounges. The hotel has its own Business Center, a1,150 square feet (107 m) digital facility, where guests can access the Internet and photocopy. In 2004 the hotel launched a line of products in keeping with the Art Deco style of the hotel, reportedly becoming the first individual hotel in the world to have its own merchandise collection. Secret railway Track (edit) Underneath the hotel is a private railway track and platform directly connected to the Grand Central Terminal, referred to as Track 61. Restaurants and cuisine (edit) 1918 menu for a dinner honoring Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of York The Waldorf Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service and was the first major hotel in the world to hire women as chefs, beginning in 1931. An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975. As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year, and got through27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar,380,000 pints of strawberries annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut,1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eaten on gold china plates. One 1973 feast by the Explorer's Club devoured hippo meat, a 4-foot (1.2 m) alligator, a baby shark, an amberjack tuna, a boa, wild boar hams, 480 pieces of breaded-fried cod tongues and cheeks, antelope steaks, two boxes of Chinese rabbit, and 20 pounds of rattlesnake. Breakfast at the Waldorf Astoria The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and Oscar's Brasserie, as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese Inagiku. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants. Peacock Alley, situated in the heart of the lobby, features an Art Deco design with gilded ceilings and includes a main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. It is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes. Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces. The Bull and Bear Steak House is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style, and has a ``den-like'' atmosphere, and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef. It has won awards from the National Restaurant Association and Holiday magazine. Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for Fox Business Happy Hour, presented live between 5 and 6 pm. The Bull and Bear Bar is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent the successful men of Wall Street. The Inagiku, meaning the ``rice chrysanthemum'', serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by Henry Look of San Francisco, the restaurant has four ``distinctly different'' rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple. Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox tatami rooms. The classic Waldorf Salad Oscar's Brasserie, overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by Adam Tihany. The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky (Oscar of the Waldorf) and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar. The Waldorf salad--a salad made with apples, walnuts, celery, grapes, and mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-based dressing--was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar. The original recipe, however did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in The Rector Cook Book in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his ``Oscar's Sauce'', which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel. Another of the hotel's specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts. Sir Harry's Bar is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir Harry Johnston (1858--1927). In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a ``plush African safari'' design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with ``zebra-striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent-cane furnishings''. It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a 23 feet (7.0 m) by 8 feet (2.4 m) ebony bar as of the early 1990s. Frank Sinatra frequented Sir Harry's Bar for many years. In 1991, while drinking at Sir Harry's with Jilly Rizzo and Steve Lawrence, he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, ``Don't you see I'm on my own time here? You asshole. What's wrong with you?'' The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained. Cocktail books (edit) Albert Stevens Crockett, the hotel's veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book ``Old Waldorf Bar Days'' in 1931 during Prohibition and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was an homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett's takes on the original hand-written leather bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted. In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, ``The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book'', in response to the repeal of the Volstead Act and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the ``Cuban Concoctions'' and ``Jamaican Jollifers'' chapters. These books became reference books on the subject ofpre-Prohibition cocktails and its culture. In 2016, the long-time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, Frank Caiafa, added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa's ``The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book'' includes all of the recipes in Crockett's books; many of the hotel's most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations. In 2017, it was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Beverage Book. Other notable books with connections to the hotel include ``Drinks'' (1914) by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel's notable recipes. Tschirky himself compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own book ``100 Famous Cocktails'' (1934), a selection of favorites from Crockett's books. Finally, hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote ``Bottoms Up'' in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day. Notable residents and tenants (edit) Leaders and businesspeople (edit) Eleanor Roosevelt and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway with Princess Juliana and Thomas Watson On the 100th anniversary of the hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: ``It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there.'' From its inception, the Waldorf was always a ``must stay'' hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year. The Khrushchev family at the Waldorf Astoria in 1959 In modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty. An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floors mats. One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J.W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to$50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel. Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s. Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre, and Fidel Castro once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away. While serving as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced them with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed First Lady also once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100 watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight; she further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available. Herbert Hoover who lived at the Waldorf for over 30 years from the end of his presidency Postmaster General James Farley occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there until he died in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite. The official residence of the United States 'Permanent Representative to the United Nations, an unnamed 42nd-floor apartment, has been located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. On June 17, 2015, however, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to The New York Palace Hotel. Although State Department officials did not give an official reason for the change affecting both the President and hundreds of American diplomats and support staff who travel to New York for the General Assembly each September and usually stay and hold meetings on two secured floors at the Waldorf, they pointed to Hilton Worldwide's sale of the Waldorf-Astoria to China's Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group for$1.95 billion in 2014, a deal that prompted security concerns. While the terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years, they also call for ``a major renovation'' that the officials say has raised eyebrows in the US Government because of concerns about Chinese eavesdropping and cyber espionage. Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and member of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and fellow Filipino Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another connection with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser. Celebrities (edit) Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra The hotel has had many well-known under its roof throughout its history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Liv Ullmann, Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, Ray Bolger, John Wayne, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Muhammad Ali, Vince Lombardi, Judy Garland, Sonny Werblin, Greer Garson, Harold Lloyd, Liberace, Burt Reynolds, Robert Montgomery, Cesar Romero, and many others. Due to the number of high-profile guests staying at the hotel at any one time, author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Towers as a ``kind of vertical Beverly Hills. On any one given night you might find Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra (or) Zsa Zsa Gabor staying there''. Gabor married Conrad Hilton in 1941. During the 1930s, gangster Benjamin ``Bugsy'' Siegel owned an apartment at the Waldorf, and Frank Costello was said to have got his haircut and nails done in the Barber's Shop at the Waldorf. Around the time of World War I, inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the earlier Waldorf-Astoria. In 1955, Marilyn Monroe stayed at the hotel for several months, but due to costs of trying to finance her production company ``Marilyn Monroe Productions'', only being paid$1,500 a week for her role in The Seven Year Itch and being suspended from 20th Century Fox for walking out on Fox after creative differences, living at the hotel became too costly and Monroe had to move into a different hotel in New York City. Around the same time that Monroe lived in the hotel, Cole Porter and Linda Lee Thomas had an apartment in the Waldorf Towers, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter's 1934 song ``You're the Top'', contains the lyric, ``You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad''. The Cole Porter Suite, Suite 33A, was the place where Porter lived and entertained for a period. Frank Sinatra paid nearly$1 million a year to keep it as his personal suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988, which he called ``home'' when out of Los Angeles. Sinatra took over part of the hotel during the filming of The First Deadly Sin in 1980. The casts of Parks and Recreation, Portlandia, and Game of Thrones at the 71st Annual Peabody Awards inside the Waldorf Astoria. From left to right: JimO'Heir, Nick Offerman, Aziz Ansari, Adam Scott, Carrie Brownstein, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Aubrey Plaza, and Retta Grace Kelly and Rainier III were regular guests at the hotel. At one time Kelly was reputed to be in love with the hotel banquet manager of the Waldorf, Claudius Charles Philippe. Elizabeth Taylor frequented the hotel, and would often attend galas at the hotel to talk about her various causes. Her visits were excitedly awaited by the hotel staff, who would prepare long in advance. Taylor was honored at the 1983 Friars Club dinner at the hotel. In 1980, John Travolta's brother Joey Travolta and Wendy Shawn, the daughter of comedian Dick Shawn, had their wedding reception at the hotel. Brooke Shields has stated that her very first encounter with the paparazzi was in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf at the age of 12, stating that she ``stood like a statue wondering why they were all hired to photograph me'', and that she ``debuted at the Waldorf''. During her childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, Paris Hilton lived with her family in the hotel. 58th International Debutante Ball, 2012, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City One of the most prestigious, the most exclusive and the most famous debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only International Debutante Ball held biennially in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. The International Debutante Ball has presented princesses, countesses, baronesses and many European royalty and aristocrats as debutantes to high society. Daughters and granddaughters of billionaire businessmen, American politicians, senators, congressmen, ambassadors and even many United States Presidents have also been presented at the International Debutante Ball. In popular Culture (edit) The Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. Ginger Rogers headlined an all star ensemble cast in the 1945 film Week-End at the Waldorf, set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there. Other films shot at the hotel include The Out-of-Towners (1970), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), Coming to America (1988), Scent of a Woman (1992), The Cowboy Way (1994), Random Hearts (1999), Analyze This (1999), For Love of the Game (1999), Serendipity (2001), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Maid in Manhattan (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), End of the Century (2005), Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), The Pink Panther (2006), and The Hoax (2006). Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include Law and Order, Rescue Me, Sex and the City, The Sopranos and Will and Grace. Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including Edward Hungerford's Story of the Waldorf (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1925) and Horace Sutton's Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria (New York: Henry Holt, 1953). Langston Hughes wrote a poem entitled ``Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria'', criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel. Wallace Stevens wrote a poem entitled ``Arrival at the Waldorf'', in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of Guatemala to being ``back at the Waldorf''. In Meg Cabot's novel Jinx, the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf-Astoria. It is at this point that Tory (the main antagonist) reveals Jean's first attempt at a love spell, which served as a catalyst for the novel's events.

Sukenik was first offered the scrolls in 1947 by an antiquities dealer in Bethlehem. Because of the recent partitioning of Palestine, Jews were not permitted to travel there. Sukenik disguised himself as an Arab to travel to the city. He was allowed to examine the scrolls and to take a small fragment of one for testing. When he made the trip back to Bethlehem to purchase them the next day, he found that the dealer had been pressured into selling them to the Syriac Orthodox Church. Archbishop Mar Samuel offered to sell them to Sukenik for US$125,000; before the transaction could take place, Mar Samuel's life was threatened and he fled to the United States. Sukenik died in 1953 without further word about the whereabouts of the scrolls. In 1954, a classified ad appeared in The Wall Street Journal offering to sell the four scrolls. Yigael Yadin, the son of Professor Sukenik, was visiting the United States when the ad appeared and someone brought it to his attention. It was then planned that the State of Israel would secretly buy the scrolls. Jump up^ These include Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, Vanessa von Bismarck (great-great-granddaughter of Otto von Bismarck), Princess Natalya Elisabeth Davidovna Obolensky (granddaughter of the Prince Ivan Obolensky, the chairman of the International Debutante Ball), Princess Ines de Bourbon Parme, Countess Magdalena Habsburg-Lothringen (great-great-granddaughter of Empress Elisabeth 'Sisi 'of Austria) and Lady Henrietta Seymour (daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Somerset and descendent of Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour).

Johnson), Christine Colby (daughter of CIA director William Colby), Hollister Knowlton (future wife of CIA director David Petraeus), Charlotte and Catherine Forbes (granddaughters of Malcolm Forbes) and Christina Huffington (daughter of Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post) have all been invited to the ball. Ivanka Trump (daughter of President Donald Trump) and Sasha and Malia Obama (daughters of President Barack Obama) have also been invited to be presented as debutantes at the International Debutante Ball.

G8233 Lo 2005 Looking for Alaska is John Green's first novel, published in March 2005 by Dutton Juvenile. It won the 2006 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association, and led the association's list of most-challenged books in 2015 due to profanity and sexually explicit scenes. Looking for Alaska is inspired by Green's own experiences as a high school student. The story is told through teenager Miles ``Pudge'' Halter, as he enrolls in a boarding school to try to gain a deeper perspective on life. He meets one student in particular, Alaska Young, who he falls in love with as she guides him through his own ``labyrinth of suffering.'' After her unexpected death, he is forced to work through his internal ``labyrinth of suffering'' himself as he and his close friends attempt to uncover the truth behind Alaska's death.

As he explains, ``I myself was once a guy from Florida who was obsessed with the dying words of famous people and then left home to attend a boarding school in Alabama.'' He goes on to explain that while the novel is fictional, the setting is not. Green attended Indian Springs School, a boarding and day school outside of Birmingham, Alabama. Culver Creek of Looking for Alaska is Indian Springs School. From the smoking hole to the swing Pudge and Alaska sat on, John Green based the entire setting off of his high school. Characters are loosely based on his high school experiences, including smoking cigarettes in the woods instead of going to class. While he was enrolled there, a student died under circumstances similar to the character of Alaska, which inspired the plot of the novel. John Green discussed at a book talk in Rivermont Collegiate on October 19, 2006 that he got the idea of Takumi's ``fox hat'' from a Filipino friend who wore a similar hat while playing pranks at Indian Springs School. From the same book talk, Green also stated that the possessed swan in Culver Creek came from his student life at Indian Springs School as well, where there was also a swan of similar nature on the campus. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at his high school. Green has also stated that several of Culver Creek's teachers are direct caricatures of multiple faculty members at Indian Springs. During the week of July 29, 2012, Looking for Alaska broke into the New York Times best seller list at number ten in Children's Paperback, 385 weeks (more than seven years) after it was released. As of May 3, 2016, it is number four on the New York Times best seller listing for Young Adult Paperback. It spent eighteen weeks at number four. Despite its literary success, Looking For Alaska has often been challenged in public school districts for content considered inappropriate. Plot (edit) Miles Halter, obsessed with last words, leaves Florida to attend Culver Creek Preparatory High School in Alabama for his junior year, quoting Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's last words: ``I go to seek a Great Perhaps''. Miles 'new roommate, Chip ``The Colonel'' Martin, nicknames Miles ``Pudge'' and introduces Pudge to his friends: hip-hop emcee Takumi Hikohito and Alaska Young, a beautiful but emotionally unstable girl. Learning of Pudge's obsession with famous last words, Alaska informs him of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's: ``Damn it. How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!'' The two make a deal that if Pudge figures out what the labyrinth is, Alaska will find him a girlfriend. Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship platonic because she has a boyfriend that she insists she loves. On his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the ``Weekday Warriors,'' rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. There is much tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors because of Paul's expulsion. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also expelled during the incident. However, Alaska later admits that she told on Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being punished. The gang celebrates a series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an aneurysm when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration ', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night together. In the middle of the night, Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics, insisting that she has to leave. Pudge and the Colonel distract Mr. Starnes and Alaska drives away while drunk, crashes her car, and dies instantly. The Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, but learn that Alaska might have deliberately crashed to kill herself. They discover that Alaska was driving to her mother's grave because she had forgotten her mother's birthday. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel. As a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of The General in His Labyrinth with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words ``straight and fast'' written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave. In her rush, she might have been trying to reach the cemetery or might have committed suicide out of guilt. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska would forgive him for letting her go. Characters (edit) Miles Halter Miles ``Pudge'' Halter is nicknamed because he is tall and skinny. He is the novel's main character, who has an unusual interest in learning famous people's last words. He transfers to the boarding school Culver Creek in search of his own ``Great Perhaps''. Pudge is attracted to Alaska Young, who for most of the novel has a mixed relationship, mostly not returning his feelings. Alaska Young Alaska is the wild, unpredictable, beautiful, and enigmatic girl with a sad backstory who captures Miles 'attention and heart. She acts as a confidante to her friends, frequently assisting them in personal matters, including providing them with cigarettes and alcohol. She is described as living in a ``reckless world.'' The second half of the novel focuses around the car accident that took her life and the other characters coping with not knowing if it was an accident or a suicide. Chip Martin Chip ``The Colonel'' Martin is five feet tall but ``built like a scale model of Adonis'', he is Alaska's best friend and Miles 'roommate. He is the strategic mastermind behind the schemes that Alaska concocts, and in charge of everyone's nicknames. Coming from a poor background, he is obsessed with loyalty and honor, especially towards his beloved mother, Dolores, who lives in a trailer. Takumi Hikohito Takumi is a gifted Japanese emcee/ hip-hop enthusiast and friend of Alaska and Chip. He often feels overlooked in the plans of Miles, Chip, and Alaska. Towards the end of the novel he returns to Japan. Lara Buterskaya Lara is a Romanian immigrant, she is Alaska's friend and becomes Miles 'girlfriend and, eventually,ex-girlfriend. She is described as having a light accent. Mr. Starnes Mr. Starnes is the stern Dean of Students at Culver Creek, nicknamed ``The Eagle'' by the students. He is pranked by Miles, Chip, Alaska, Lara and Takumi multiple times throughout the novel. Themes (edit) Search for meaning (edit) After Alaska's death, Pudge and Colonel investigate the circumstances surrounding the traumatic event. While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession over these answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the ``Great Perhaps, ''' meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life. Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life. Grief (edit) When Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Scholar Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why. She also points out that in writing Looking for Alaska, John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question ``how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?'' Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way. Coming of age (edit) Throughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. By the end of the book, it is clear that Miles has grown throughout the year. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective. Scholar Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of they labyrinth of suffering is Miles '``rite of passage'' into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska. Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel. Hope (edit) The theme of hope plays a major role in Looking for Alaska. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, John Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict brought on by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to ``'keep that fragile strand of radical hope (alive), to build a fire in the darkness. ''' Reception (edit) Reviews of Looking for Alaska are generally positive. Many comment on the relatable high school characters and situations as well as more complex ideas such as how topics like grief are handled. Overall, many reviewers agree that this is a coming of age story that is appealing to both older and younger readers. There has been much controversy surrounding this novel, however, especially in school settings. Parents and school administrators have questioned the novel's language, sexual content, and depiction of tobacco and alcohol use. Looking for Alaska has been featured on the American Library Association's list of Frequently Challenged Books in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. The novel was awarded the Michael L. Printz award in 2006 and has also won praise from organizations such as the American Library Association, School Library Journal, and the Lost Angeles Times among others. Controversy (edit) Marion County, Kentucky (edit) In 2016 in Marion County, Kentucky, parents have urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students ``to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.'' Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book. One parent still insisted on getting the book banned and filed a Request for Reconsideration on the basis that Looking For Alaska would tempt students to experiment with drugs, alcohol, and sex despite the decisions made after the challenge. Depew high school, Buffalo New York (edit) Two teachers at Depew High School near Buffalo, New York, used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. Looking For Alaska was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as ``pornographic'', and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. Looking for Alaska was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure. Knox and Sumner counties, Tennessee (edit) In March 2012, The Knoxville Journal reported that a parent of a 15-year-old Karns High School student objected to the book's placement on the Honors and Advanced Placement classes 'required reading lists for Knox County high schools on the grounds that its sex scene and its use of profanity rendered it pornography. Ultimately, students were kept from reading the novel as a whole, but Looking For Alaska was still available in libraries within the district. In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of Looking For Alaska. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel. Controversy due to cover design (edit) Further controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to ``an improbable amount of smoke'', and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke. In John Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed. Author's response to controversy (edit) Green defended his book in his vlog, Vlogbrothers. The video, entitled ``I Am Not A Pornographer'', describes the Depew High School challenge of Looking For Alaska and his anger at the description of his novel as pornography. Green defends the inclusion of the oral sex scene in Looking for Alaska stating, ``The whole reason that scene in question exists in Looking for Alaska is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.'' Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and calls to people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also condemns the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to defend the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have Looking For Alaska included in public schools. Adaptation (edit) The film rights to the novel were acquired by Paramount Pictures in 2005. The screenplay was potentially going to be written and directed by Josh Schwartz (creator of The O.C.) but, due to a lack of interest by Paramount, the production had been shelved indefinitely. It had been reported that Paramount was putting the screenplay in review due to the success of the film adaptation of Green's breakout novel, The Fault in Our Stars. On February 27, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, screenwriters for Temple Hill Entertainment who had worked on adaptations for The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns, would be writing and executive producing for the film. Paramount was actively casting the latest version of the screenplay, which was written by Sarah Polley. Rebecca Thomas was set to direct. Green also confirmed that Neustadter and Weber were still involved with the film. In August 2015, it was announced filming would begin in the fall in Michigan. It was later announced that filming would begin in early 2016 because of lack of casting decisions. Later in 2016, John Green announced in a Vlogbrother's video and on social media that the film adaption has once again been shelved indefinitely. John Green explained, ``It has always fallen apart of one reason or another.'' On May 9, 2018 it was announced that Hulu would be adapting the novel into an 8-episode limited series.

In many cases it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and the links their interactions. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe. Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are ``complex'' have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their own independent area of research.

The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism, which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them. As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of self-organization from physics, that of spontaneous order from the social sciences, chaos from mathematics, adaptation from biology, and many others. Complex systems is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including statistical physics, information theory, nonlinear dynamics, anthropology, computer science, meteorology, sociology, economics, psychology, and biology. Key concepts (edit) Systems (edit) Open systems have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings. Complex systems is chiefly concerned with the behaviors and properties of systems. A system, broadly defined, is a set of entities that, through their interactions, relationships, or dependencies, form a unified whole. It is always defined in terms of its boundary, which determines the entities that are or are not part of the system. Entities lying outside the system then become part of the system's environment. A system can exhibit properties that produce behaviors which are distinct from the properties and behaviors of its parts; these system-wide or global properties and behaviors are characteristics of how the system interacts with or appears to its environment, or of how its parts behave (say, in response to external stimuli) by virtue of being within the system. The notion of behavior implies that the study of systems is also concerned with processes that take place over time (or, in mathematics, some other phase space parameterization). Because of their broad, interdisciplinary applicability, systems concepts play a central role in complex systems. As a field of study, complex systems is a subset of systems theory. General systems theory focuses similarly on the collective behaviors of interacting entities, but it studies a much broader class of systems, includingnon-complex systems where traditional reductionist approaches may remain viable. Indeed, systems theory seeks to explore and describe all classes of systems, and the invention of categories that are useful to researchers across widely varying fields is one of systems theory's main objectives. As it relates to complex systems, systems theory contributes an emphasis on the way relationships and dependencies between a system's parts can determine system-wide properties. It also contributes the interdisciplinary perspective of the study of complex systems: the notion that shared properties link systems across disciplines, justifying the pursuit of modeling approaches applicable to complex systems wherever they appear. Specific concepts important to complex systems, such as emergence, feedback loops, and adaptation, also originate in systems theory. Complexity (edit) Systems exhibit complexity when difficulties with modeling them are endemic. This means their behaviors can not be understood apart from the very properties that make them difficult to model, and they are governed entirely, or almost entirely, by the behaviors those properties produce. Any modeling approach that ignores such difficulties or characterizes them as noise, then, will necessarily produce models that are neither accurate nor useful. As yet no fully general theory of complex systems has emerged for addressing these problems, so researchers must solve them in domain-specific contexts. Researchers in complex systems address these problems by viewing the chief task of modeling to be capturing, rather than reducing, the complexity of their respective systems of interest. While no generally accepted exact definition of complexity exists yet, there are many archetypal examples of complexity. Systems can be complex if, for instance, they have chaotic behavior (behavior that exhibits extreme sensitivity to initial conditions), or if they have emergent properties (properties that are not apparent from their components in isolation but which result from the relationships and dependencies they form when placed together in a system), or if they are computationally intractable to model (if they depend on a number of parameters that grows too rapidly with respect to the size of the system). Networks (edit) The interacting components of a complex system form a network, which is a collection of discrete objects and relationships between them, usually depicted as a graph of vertices connected by edges. Networks can describe the relationships between individuals within an organization, between logic gates in a circuit, between genes in gene regulatory networks, or between any other set of related entities. Networks often describe the sources of complexity in complex systems. Studying complex systems as networks therefore enables many useful applications of graph theory and network science. Some complex systems, for example, are also complex networks, which have properties such as phase transitions and power-law degree distributions that readily lend themselves to emergent or chaotic behavior. The fact that the number of edges in a complete graph grows quadratically in the number of vertices sheds additional light on the source of complexity in large networks: as a network grows, the number of relationships between entities quickly dwarfs the number of entities in the network. Nonlinearity (edit) A sample solution in the Lorenz attractor when \u03c1= 28, \u03c3= 10, and \u03b2= 8/ 3 Complex systems often have nonlinear behavior, meaning they may respond in different ways to the same input depending on their state or context. In mathematics and physics, nonlinearity describes systems in which a change in the size of the input does not produce a proportional change in the size of the output. For a given change in input, such systems may yield significantly greater than or less than proportional changes in output, or even no output at all, depending on the current state of the system or its parameter values. Of particular interest to complex systems are nonlinear dynamical systems, which are systems of differential equations that have one or more nonlinear terms. Some nonlinear dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz system, can produce a mathematical phenomenon known as chaos. Chaos as it applies to complex systems refers to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, or ``butterfly effect,'' that a complex system can exhibit. In such a system, small changes to initial conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. Chaotic behavior can therefore be extremely hard to model numerically, because small rounding errors at an intermediate stage of computation can cause the model to generate completely inaccurate output. Furthermore, if a complex system returns to a state similar to one it held previously, it may behave completely differently in response to exactly the same stimuli, so chaos also poses challenges for extrapolating from past experience. Emergence (edit) Gosper's Glider Gun creating ``gliders'' in the cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life Another common feature of complex systems is the presence of emergent behaviors and properties: these are traits of a system which are not apparent from its components in isolation but which result from the interactions, dependencies, or relationships they form when placed together in a system. Emergence broadly describes the appearance of such behaviors and properties, and has applications to systems studied in both the social and physical sciences. While emergence is often used to refer only to the appearance of unplanned organized behavior in a complex system, emergence can also refer to the breakdown of organization; it describes any phenomena which are difficult or even impossible to predict from the smaller entities that make up the system. One example of complex system whose emergent properties have been studied extensively is cellular automata. In a cellular automaton, a grid of cells, each having one of finitely many states, evolves over time according to a simple set of rules. These rules guide the ``interactions'' of each cell with its neighbors. Although the rules are only defined locally, they have been shown capable of producing globally interesting behavior, for example in Conway's Game of Life. Spontaneous order and self-organization (edit) When emergence describes the appearance of unplanned order, it is spontaneous order (in the social sciences) or self-organization (in physical sciences). Spontaneous order can be seen in herd behavior, whereby a group of individuals coordinates their actions without centralized planning. Self-organization can be seen in the global symmetry of certain crystals, for instance the apparent radial symmetry of snowflakes, which arises from purely local attractive and repulsive forces both between water molecules and between water molecules and their surrounding environment. Adaptation (edit) Complex adaptive systems are special cases of complex systems that are adaptive in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the stock market, social insect and ant colonies, the biosphere and the ecosystem, the brain and the immune system, the cell and the developing embryo, manufacturing businesses and any human social group-based endeavor in a cultural and social system such as political parties or communities. Features (edit) Complex systems may have the following features: Cascading failures Due to the strong coupling between components in complex systems, a failure in one or more components can lead to cascading failures which may have catastrophic consequences on the functioning of the system. Localized attack may lead to cascading failures in spatial networks. Complex systems may be open Complex systems are usually open systems--that is, they exist in a thermodynamic gradient and dissipate energy. In other words, complex systems are frequently far from energetic equilibrium: but despite this flux, there may be pattern stability, see synergetics. Complex systems may have a memory The history of a complex system may be important. Because complex systems are dynamical systems they change over time, and prior states may have an influence on present states. More formally, complex systems often exhibit spontaneous failures and recovery as well as hysteresis. Interacting systems may have complex hysteresis of many transitions. Complex systems may be nested The components of a complex system may themselves be complex systems. For example, an economy is made up of organisations, which are made up of people, which are made up of cells-all of which are complex systems. Dynamic network of multiplicity As well as coupling rules, the dynamic network of a complex system is important. Small-world or scale-free networks which have many local interactions and a smaller number ofinter-area connections are often employed. Natural complex systems often exhibit such topologies. In the human cortex for example, we see dense local connectivity and a few very long axon projections between regions inside the cortex and to other brain regions. May produce emergent phenomena Complex systems may exhibit behaviors that are emergent, which is to say that while the results may be sufficiently determined by the activity of the systems 'basic constituents, they may have properties that can only be studied at a higher level. For example, the termites in a mound have physiology, biochemistry and biological development that are at one level of analysis, but their social behavior and mound building is a property that emerges from the collection of termites and needs to be analysed at a different level. Relationships arenon-linear In practical terms, this means a small perturbation may cause a large effect (see butterfly effect), a proportional effect, or even no effect at all. In linear systems, effect is always directly proportional to cause. See nonlinearity. Relationships contain feedback loops Both negative (damping) and positive (amplifying) feedback are always found in complex systems. The effects of an element's behaviour are fed back to in such a way that the element itself is altered. History (edit) A perspective on the development of complexity science:http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html Although it is arguable that humans have been studying complex systems for thousands of years, the modern scientific study of complex systems is relatively young in comparison to established fields of science such as physics and chemistry. The history of the scientific study of these systems follows several different research trends. In the area of mathematics, arguably the largest contribution to the study of complex systems was the discovery of chaos in deterministic systems, a feature of certain dynamical systems that is strongly related to nonlinearity. The study of neural networks was also integral in advancing the mathematics needed to study complex systems. The notion of self-organizing systems is tied with work in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, including that pioneered by chemist and Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine in his study of dissipative structures. Even older is the work by Hartree-Fock c.s. on the quantum-chemistry equations and later calculations of the structure of molecules which can be regarded as one of the earliest examples of emergence and emergent wholes in science. The earliest precursor to modern complex systems theory can be found in the classical political economy of the Scottish Enlightenment, later developed by the Austrian school of economics, which argues that order in market systems is spontaneous (or emergent) in that it is the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design. Upon this the Austrian school developed from the 19th to the early 20th century the economic calculation problem, along with the concept of dispersed knowledge, which were to fuel debates against the then-dominant Keynesian economics. This debate would notably lead economists, politicians and other parties to explore the question of computational complexity. A pioneer in the field, and inspired by Karl Popper's and Warren Weaver's works, Nobel prize economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek dedicated much of his work, from early to the late 20th century, to the study of complex phenomena, not constraining his work to human economies but venturing into other fields such as psychology, biology and cybernetics. Gregory Bateson played a key role in establishing the connection between anthropology and systems theory; he recognized that the interactive parts of cultures function much like ecosystems. While the explicit study of complex systems dates at least to the 1970s, the first research institute focused on complex systems, the Santa Fe Institute, was founded in 1984. Early Santa Fe Institute participants included physics Nobel laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Philip Anderson, economics Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, and Manhattan Project scientists George Cowan and Herb Anderson. Today, there are over 50 institutes and research centers focusing on complex systems. Applications (edit) Complexity in practice (edit) The traditional approach to dealing with complexity is to reduce or constrain it. Typically, this involves compartmentalisation: dividing a large system into separate parts. Organizations, for instance, divide their work into departments that each deal with separate issues. Engineering systems are often designed using modular components. However, modular designs become susceptible to failure when issues arise that bridge the divisions. Complexity management (edit) As projects and acquisitions become increasingly complex, companies and governments are challenged to find effective ways to managemega-acquisitions such as the Army Future Combat Systems. Acquisitions such as the FCS rely on a web of interrelated parts which interact unpredictably. As acquisitions become more network-centric and complex, businesses will be forced to find ways to manage complexity while governments will be challenged to provide effective governance to ensure flexibility and resiliency. Complexity economics (edit) Over the last decades, within the emerging field of complexity economics new predictive tools have been developed to explain economic growth. Such is the case with the models built by the Santa Fe Institute in 1989 and the more recent economic complexity index (ECI), introduced by the MIT physicist Cesar A. Hidalgo and the Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann. Based on the ECI, Hausmann, Hidalgo and their team of The Observatory of Economic Complexity have produced GDP forecasts for the year 2020. Complexity and education (edit) Focusing on issues of student persistence with their studies, Forsman, Moll and Linder explore the ``viability of using complexity science as a frame to extend methodological applications for physics education research'', finding that ``framing a social network analysis within a complexity science perspective offers a new and powerful applicability across a broad range of PER topics''. Complexity and modeling (edit) One of Friedrich Hayek's main contributions to early complexity theory is his distinction between the human capacity to predict the behaviour of simple systems and its capacity to predict the behaviour of complex systems through modeling. He believed that economics and the sciences of complex phenomena in general, which in his view included biology, psychology, and so on, could not be modeled after the sciences that deal with essentially simple phenomena like physics. Hayek would notably explain that complex phenomena, through modeling, can only allow pattern predictions, compared with the precise predictions that can be made out ofnon-complex phenomena. Complexity and chaos theory (edit) Complexity theory is rooted in chaos theory, which in turn has its origins more than a century ago in the work of the French mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9. Chaos is sometimes viewed as extremely complicated information, rather than as an absence of order. Chaotic systems remain deterministic, though their long-term behavior can be difficult to predict with any accuracy. With perfect knowledge of the initial conditions and of the relevant equations describing the chaotic system's behavior, one can theoretically make perfectly accurate predictions about the future of the system, though in practice this is impossible to do with arbitrary accuracy. Ilya Prigogine argued that complexity isnon-deterministic, and gives no way whatsoever to precisely predict the future. The emergence of complexity theory shows a domain between deterministic order and randomness which is complex. This is referred as the ``edge of chaos''. A plot of the Lorenz attractor. When one analyzes complex systems, sensitivity to initial conditions, for example, is not an issue as important as it is within chaos theory, in which it prevails. As stated by Colander, the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, is the result of a relatively small number ofnon-linear interactions. Therefore, the main difference between chaotic systems and complex systems is their history. Chaotic systems do not rely on their history as complex ones do. Chaotic behaviour pushes a system in equilibrium into chaotic order, which means, in other words, out of what we traditionally define as 'order '. On the other hand, complex systems evolve far from equilibrium at the edge of chaos. They evolve at a critical state built up by a history of irreversible and unexpected events, which physicist Murray Gell-Mann called ``an accumulation of frozen accidents''. In a sense chaotic systems can be regarded as a subset of complex systems distinguished precisely by this absence of historical dependence. Many real complex systems are, in practice and over long but finite time periods, robust. However, they do possess the potential for radical qualitative change of kind whilst retaining systemic integrity. Metamorphosis serves as perhaps more than a metaphor for such transformations. Complexity and network science (edit) A complex system is usually composed of many components and their interactions. Such a system can be represented by a network where nodes represent the components and links represent their interactions. for example, the INTERNET can be represented as a network composed of nodes (computers) and links (direct connections between computers). Its resilience to failures was studied using percolation theory in. Other examples are social networks, airline networks, biological networks and climate networks. Networks can also fail and recover spontaneously. For modeling this phenomenon see Majdandzik et al. Interacting complex systems can be modeled as networks of networks. For their breakdown and recovery properties see Gao et al. Traffic in a city can be represented as a network. The weighted links represent the velocity between two junctions (nodes). This approach was found useful to characterize the global traffic efficiency in a city. General form of complexity computation (edit) The computational law of reachable optimality is established as a general form of computation for ordered systems and it reveals complexity computation is a compound computation of optimal choice and optimality driven reaching pattern overtime underlying a specific and any experience path of ordered system within the general limitation of system integrity. The computational law of reachable optimality has four key components as described below. 1. Reachability of Optimality: Any intended optimality shall be reachable. Unreachable optimality has no meaning for a member in the ordered system and even for the ordered system itself. 2. Prevailing and Consistency: Maximizing reachability to explore best available optimality is the prevailing computation logic for all members in the ordered system and is accommodated by the ordered system. 3. Conditionality: Realizable tradeoff between reachability and optimality depends primarily upon the initial bet capacity and how the bet capacity evolves along with the payoff table update path triggered by bet behavior and empowered by the underlying law of reward and punishment. Precisely, it is a sequence of conditional events where the next event happens upon reached status quo from experience path. 4. Robustness: The more challenge a reachable optimality can accommodate, the more robust it is in term of path integrity. There are also four computation features in the law of reachable optimality. 1. Optimal Choice: Computation in realizing Optimal Choice can be very simple or very complex. A simple rule in Optimal Choice is to accept whatever is reached, Reward As You Go (RAYG). A Reachable Optimality computation reduces into optimizing reachability when RAYG is adopted. The Optimal Choice computation can be more complex when multiple NE strategies present in a reached game. 2. Initial Status: Computation is assumed to start at an interested beginning even the absolute beginning of an ordered system in nature may not and need not present. An assumed neutral Initial Status facilitates an artificial or a simulating computation and is not expected to change the prevalence of any findings. 3. Territory: An ordered system shall have a territory where the universal computation sponsored by the system will produce an optimal solution still within the territory. 4. Reaching Pattern: The forms of Reaching Pattern in the computation space, or the Optimality Driven Reaching Pattern in the computation space, primarily depend upon the nature and dimensions of measure space underlying a computation space and the law of punishment and reward underlying the realized experience path of reaching. There are five basic forms of experience path we are interested in, persistently positive reinforcement experience path, persistently negative reinforcement experience path, mixed persistent pattern experience path, decaying scale experience path and selection experience path. The compound computation in selection experience path includes current and lagging interaction, dynamic topological transformation and implies both invariance and variance characteristics in an ordered system's experience path. In addition, the computation law of reachable optimality gives out the boundary between complexity model, chaotic model and determination model. When RAYG is the Optimal Choice computation, and the reaching pattern is a persistently positive experience path, persistently negative experience path, or mixed persistent pattern experience path, the underlying computation shall be a simple system computation adopting determination rules. If the reaching pattern has no persistent pattern experienced in RAYG regime, the underlying computation hints there is a chaotic system. When the optimal choice computation involvesnon-RAYG computation, it's a complexity computation driving the compound effect.

Irish Cup Organising body Irish Football Association Founded 1881 Region Ireland (1881--1921) Northern Ireland (since 1921) Number of teams 129 (2015--16) International cup (s) UEFA Europa League Current champions Coleraine Most successful club (s) Linfield (43 titles) Television broadcasters BBC Sport (highlights& live final) Website Irish Cup 2017--18 The Irish Football Association Challenge Cup (also known as the Tennent's Irish Cup for sponsorship purposes) is the primary football knock-out cup competition in Northern Ireland. Inaugurated in 1881, it is the fourth-oldest national cup competition in the world. Prior to the break-away from the Irish Football Association by clubs from what would become the Irish Free State in 1921, the Irish Cup was the national cup competition for the whole of Ireland. Coleraine are the current holders after beating Cliftonville 3-1 in the 2018 final. Since December 2015, the cup has been sponsored by Tennent's Lager--the competition's first title sponsor since 2012. It was previously sponsored by Nationwide Building Society, Bass Ireland Ltd and JJB Sports. 129 clubs entered the 2015--16 competition. Contents 1 Format 2 History 3 Records 4 Final results 5 Statistics 5.1 Performance By Club 5.2 Total cups won by town or city 5.3 Final venues 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links Format (edit) Different formats and rules have been used in the past in respect of eligibility to enter the competition, the number of teams and rounds, replays, extra time, penalties, etc. The competition begins in August or September with the first round, and ends with the final in May of the following year. The competition is open to all clubs in Northern Ireland with intermediate or senior status. Clubs obtain such status by meeting minimum criteria laid down by the Irish Football Association in respect of facilities, etc. Each club, for example, must have its own enclosed ground. Members of the NIFL Premier Intermediate League and all regional league entrants from level 4 and below enter in the first round, sometimes necessitating byes into the second round, depending on the number of entrants. The 24 senior members of the Northern Ireland Football League are exempt until the fifth round, which consists of 32 clubs and is played in January. The competition has always been played in a randomly drawn knock-out format. Teams are drawn against each other randomly. The team who is drawn first from each tie is the home team, except in the case of an intermediate team from outside the Championship drawn first against a senior team, when the tie is played at the ground of the senior team. If the match finishes in a draw after 90 minutes, extra time is played and (if necessary) penalties are used to decide the winner. Bothsemi-finals and the final are played at Windsor Park. The Cup winners qualify to represent Northern Ireland in the following season's UEFA Europa League. However, if they have already qualified for European competition as winners or runners-up of the NIFL Premiership, the 4th-placed Premiership club are awarded the berth, and do not have to participate in the Premiership's Europa League play-offs. History (edit) Since its inception in 1881, the Irish Cup has always been, and continues to be, considered the most important such competition in Northern Ireland (and, prior to 1921, Ireland), second only to the NIFL Premiership. The Cup Final is the climax of the domestic season in Northern Ireland and usually attracts the biggest attendance of any club match. The Irish Cup started in the 1880--81 season. The draw for the first round took place on 10 January 1881. The trophy was first awarded to Moyola Park (from Castledawson in County Londonderry) when they beat Cliftonville (from Belfast) 1--0 in the final at Cliftonville Cricket Ground, Belfast on 9 April 1881. Since the inception of the Irish Football League in 1890--91 (and excluding the First and Second World War years when the League was suspended), the Cup has been won by Irish League clubs on every occasion except three famous 'giant-killing 'occasions when ``junior'' clubs beat senior opponents in the final: in 1928, Willowfield beat Larne 1--0; in 1955, Dundela beat Glenavon 3--0; and in 1976, Carrick Rangers beat Linfield 2--1. In the early years, Army regiments stationed in Ireland entered teams such as King's Own Rifles (Cork), three of which reached the final: the Gordon Highlanders in 1890, the Black Watch (Limerick) in 1892 and the Sherwood Foresters (Curragh, County Kildare) in 1897. The Gordon Highlanders were the only Army team to win the Cup. From 1881 to 1921, when the Irish Cup was an all-Ireland competition, southern clubs (from what would become the Irish Free State and later the Republic of Ireland) only won the competition four times out of a possible 41: Shelbourne (from Dublin) won three times (in 1906, 1911 and 1920); and Bohemians (also from Dublin) won it in 1908. There were two all-southern finals: Bohemians defeating Shelbourne in 1908, and Shelbourne defeating Bohemians in 1911 (both ties required replays). Shelbourne, Bohemians and Derry City are the only clubs to win both the Irish Cup and the FAI Cup. Other Dublin clubs to compete in the Irish Cup were Dublin University, St. James's Gate, Dublin Association, Tritonville and Richmond Rovers. In the second competition in 1881--82, Queen's Island became the first Belfast club to win the Cup and it did not leave Belfast again for another 24 years, when in 1905--06, Shelbourne became the first club from Dublin to win it. Of the 135 competitions played since 1881, Belfast clubs have won the Cup 100 times. The last time a club from outside Belfast won the cup was in 2014, when Glenavon beat Ballymena United 2--1 to win the cup for the sixth time and become the cup's most successful club from outside Belfast. In the early years of the competition the final was played at several different venues in Belfast, including the Oval, Solitude, Grosvenor Park and Celtic Park, as well as Dalymount Park in Dublin. From 1996--2014 the final was played exclusively at Windsor Park. However, the 2015 final had to be switched to the Oval, following the discovery of damage to a stand at the usual Windsor Park venue. The first final ever played outside Belfast took place in 1903, when Distillery won their 7th Irish Cup with a 3--1 victory over Bohemians at Dalymount Park, Dublin. The last final to be played outside Belfast was in 1975; Coleraine winning the Cup with a 1--0 victory over Linfield in the second replay, after 1--1 and 0--0 draws in the first two games. Since then the final has been played at either The Oval, or Windsor Park. The first final between two clubs from outside Belfast was in 1908, when Bohemians beat Shelbourne 3--1 after a replay. In 1921, Glenavon became the first club from County Armagh to reach the final, but no club from Armagh won the Cup until Glenavon in 1957. County Down's first Cup finalists and winners were Ards in 1927; and County Antrim's were Ballymena in 1929. In 2007, Dungannon Swifts became the first club from County Tyrone to reach the final. Prior to replays being abolished in the final, a replay was required to decide the winner of 21 finals, the first in 1890 after Cliftonville and the Gordon Highlanders drew 2--2. Of the 21 finals to be replayed, eight of them required a second replay to separate the two finalists. The last time this occurred, and the last final replay ever played before they were abolished was in 1993, when Bangor defeated Ards 1--0 after two 1--1 draws. It was decided after this that there should only be one replay in which penalties would be used to determine the winner if necessary, and eventually the rules were changed to remove final replays altogether, with penalties being used if necessary after extra time in the first match. The first, and to date only final to be won on penalties took place in 2007, when Linfield beat Dungannon Swifts 3--2 on penalties following a 2--2 draw after extra time. In 2014, the rules were changed to abolish replays from the entire competition. All ties level after 90 minutes now use 30 minutes of extra time, and if necessary, a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. The final was not played on three occasions: In 1912, Linfield were awarded the Cup after the other threesemi-finalists (Cliftonville, Glentoran and Shelbourne) resigned from the IFA in a dispute over referee's wages. In 1920, Shelbourne, who had beaten Glenavon in onesemi-final, were awarded the Cup after the othersemi-final was declared null and void as both of the clubs involved were ejected from the competition: Belfast Celtic after Celtic fans fired shots at Glentoran supporters during a riot, and Glentoran for fielding an unlisted player. In 1999, Portadown were awarded the Cup when the other finalists, Cliftonville, were ejected from the competition after it was discovered that they had fielded an ineligible player during the earlier rounds. A total of 24 different clubs have won the Cup, but only 13 clubs have done so more than once. 33 different clubs have reached the final, with 11 of them appearing only once. Of those 11 clubs, five of them have won the Cup in their sole final appearance. On five occasions the same two clubs have reached the final in consecutive years: in 1885 and 1886, Distillery and Alexander; in 1913 and 1914, Glentoran and Linfield; in 1930 and 1931, Ballymena United and Linfield; Coleraine and Glentoran in 2003 and 2004; and in 2011 and 2012 Linfield and Crusaders. The most common final has been between Glentoran and Linfield, which has occurred 15 times. Linfield have won eight of the meetings, with Glentoran winning seven. The last time both clubs reached the final was in 2006, when Linfield won 2--1. In 2001, the final was broadcast live on television for the first time on BBC Northern Ireland and has been on every occasion since Windsor Park has hosted the most finals (70, including replays), followed by The Oval with 25, and Solitude with 22.

As the nation's first hour-long nightly news broadcast, the program is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events. Anchored by Judy Woodruff, the program's weekday broadcasts run one hour in length and are produced by Washington, DC PBS station WETA-TV. From August 2013 to October 2016, Woodruff and then-co-anchor Gwen Ifill were the first and only all-female anchor team of a national nightly news program on broadcast television. Since its launch in September 2013, 30-minute, Saturday and Sunday editions of the program (titled as PBS NewsHour Weekend) have been anchored by Hari Sreenivasan and produced by New York City PBS station WNET. The PBS NewsHour originates from WETA's studio facilities in Arlington County, Virginia (for its weekday editions), and the Tisch/ WNET Studios at Lincoln Center in Manhattan (for its weekend editions); additional facilities are located in San Francisco and Denver. The program is a collaboration between WETA-TV, WNET, and fellow PBS member stations KQED in San Francisco, KETC in St. Louis and WTTW in Chicago.

The two earned an Emmy Award for their unprecedented gavel-to-gavel coverage. This recognition led to the 1975 creation of The Robert MacNeil Report, a half-hour local news program for WNET, which debuted on October 20 of that year; each episode of the program covered a single issue currently in the news in depth. Less than\u200b 1\u2044 months later, on December 1, 1975, the program began to air on PBS stations nationwide. The program was renamed The MacNeil/ Lehrer Report on September 9, 1976. Most editions employed a two-anchor, two-city format, with MacNeil based in New York City and Lehrer based at WETA's studios in Arlington, Virginia. Charlayne Hunter-Gault joined the series in 1978 as correspondent, serving as substitute host for MacNeil and Lehrer whenever either of them had the night off. She became the series 'national correspondent in 1983. In September 1981, production of the program was taken over by MacNeil/ Lehrer Productions, a partnership between MacNeil, Lehrer and the Gannett Company; the latter would sell its stake in the production company in 1986. Liberty Media bought a 67% controlling equity stake in MacNeil/ Lehrer Productions in 1994, but MacNeil and Lehrer retained editorial control. The final title sequence as The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, used from May 17, 2006, to December 6, 2009 The NewsHour (1983--2009) (edit) Having decided to start competing with the nightly news programs on ABC, CBS and NBC instead of complementing them, the program expanded to one hour on September 5, 1983, incorporating other changes such as the introduction of ``documentary reportage from the field''; it became known at that time as The MacNeil/ Lehrer NewsHour. Robert MacNeil retired from the program on October 20, 1995, leaving Jim Lehrer as the sole anchor (Charlayne Hunter-Gault would later leave in June 1997). Accordingly, the program was renamed The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer three days later on October 23. The NewsHour won a Peabody Award in 2003 for the feature report Jobless Recovery:Non-Working Numbers. On May 17, 2006, the program underwent its first major change in presentation in years, adopting a new graphics package and a reorchestrated version of the show's theme music (originally composed by Bernard Hoffer). On December 17, 2007, the NewsHour became the second nightly broadcast network newscast to begin broadcasting in high definition (following NBC Nightly News), with broadcasts presented in a letterboxed format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching either through cable or satellite television. The program also introduced a new set and upconverted its existing graphics package to HD. PBS NewsHour (edit) Departure of Jim Lehrer and switch toco-anchors (2009--2013) (edit) Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff at the 2012 Republican National Convention On May 11, 2009, PBS announced that the program would be revamped on December 7 of that year under a revised title as the PBS NewsHour. In addition to an increased integration between the NewsHour website and nightly broadcast, the updated production would return to a two-anchor format. The overhaul was described by Jim Lehrer as the first phase in his gradual move toward retirement. On September 27, 2010, PBS NewsHour was presented with the Chairman's Award at the 31st News& Documentary Emmy Awards, with Robert MacNeil, Jim Lehrer, longtime executive producer Les Crystal, and former executive producer Linda Winslow receiving the award on the show's behalf. Lehrer formally ended his tenure as a regular anchor of the program in June 2011. He continued to occasionally anchor on Fridays afterward, when he usually led the political analysis segment with Mark Shields and David Brooks. Transfer of production and expansion to weekends (2013--present) (edit) Judy Woodruff interviewing US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in September 2013 On August 6, 2013, Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff were named asco-anchors andco-managing editors of the NewsHour broadcast. The two shared anchor duties on the Monday through Thursday editions, with Woodruff solo anchoring on Fridays due to Ifill's duties as host of the political discussion program Washington Week (which was also produced Friday evenings). For much of its history, the PBS NewsHour aired only on Monday through Friday evenings; however on September 7, 2013, the program expanded to include weekend editions on Saturday and Sundays, with Hari Sreenivasan serving as anchor of those broadcasts. Although the weekend broadcasts are branded PBS NewsHour Weekend, those editions instead air for a half-hour; in addition, the Saturday and Sunday editions originate from the New York City studios of WNET, as opposed to the program's main production facilities at the Arlington, Virginia, studios of WETA-TV. Plans for a weekend edition of PBS NewsHour had been considered as early as March 2013. MacNeil/ Lehrer Productions announced in a letter to the show's staffers on October 8, 2013, that it had offered to transfer ownership in the PBS NewsHour to WETA. In the letter, Jim Lehrer and Robert MacNeil cited their reduced involvement with the program's production since their departures from anchoring, as well as ``the probability of increasing our fundraising abilities.'' The transfer was approved by the WETA board of trustees on June 17, 2014, and took effect on July 1. At that time, production of the program was taken over by NewsHour Productions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of WETA. WETA also acquired MacNeil/ Lehrer Productions 'archives, documentaries, and projects, though not the company's name. PBS NewsHour Weekend was not affected by the ownership transfer and continues to be produced by WNET. On July 20, 2015, the PBS NewsHour introduced an overhauled visual appearance for its weekday broadcasts, debuting a new minimalist set designed by Eric Siegel and George Allison that heavily incorporates PBS 'longtime ``Everyman'' logo. The program also introduced a new graphics package by Troika Design Group and an original theme music composition by Edd Kalehoff, which incorporates a reorchestration of the nine-note ``Question and Answer'' musical signature that has been featured within the program's theme since its premiere in 1975 and a musical signature that had been featured on Nightly Business Report between 2002 and 2010. PBS NewsHour Weekend retained its original graphics package that had been used since the launch of the Saturday and Sunday editions, as well as the theme music by David Cebert until August 29, 2015, when the program transitioned to the same theme music and a reworked version of the graphics package used for the weekday NewsHour broadcasts. Gwen Ifill took brief breaks from her anchor duties on the PBS NewsHour in the late spring and in November 2016 (and was also absent from the program's presidential election coverage on November 8), as she had been privately undergoing treatment for advanced stage breast and endometrial cancer. After her death was announced on November 14, 2016, that evening's edition of the NewsHour was turned into a tribute to Ifill and her influence on journalism, featuring tributes from Woodruff, Sreenivasan, former colleagues and program contributors (news content was relegated to the standard news summary, which aired during the second half-hour). Although the program initially featured guest anchors on some editions between January and March 2017, Judy Woodruff effectively now serves as sole anchor of the PBS NewsHour. Production and ratings (edit) Behind the scenes at The Newshour, during a Gen. Peter Pace interview The program is notable for being shown on public television. As such, there are no interruptions during the program to run advertisements (though like most public television programs, it does feature ``corporate image'' advertisements at the beginning and end of each broadcasts, as well as barker interruptions extolling viewers to donate pledges to their local PBS member station or member network during locally produced pledge drive events, which are substituted with encore presentations of a select story segment from the past year for stations that are not holding a drive during that time). The program has a more deliberate pace than the news broadcasts of the commercial networks it competes against, allowing for deeper detail in its story packages and feature segments. At the start of the program, the lead story is covered in depth, followed by a news summary that lasts roughly between six and eight minutes, briefly explaining many of the top national and international news headlines; international stories often include excerpts of reports filed by ITN correspondents. This is usually followed by three or four longer news segments--typically running six to twelve minutes each--which explore a few of the events previously mentioned in the headline segment in depth and include discussions with experts, newsmakers, and/ or commentators. The program formerly included a reflective essay on a regular basis, but these have been curtailed in recent years; since Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill became anchors of the program, these essays have mainly aired as part of the end-of-show segment ``Brief, but Spectacular''. On Fridays, the program features political analysis and discussion between two regular contributors, one from each of the Republican and Democratic parties, and one host from among the senior correspondents. Since 2004, the usual participants have been syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Analysts who fill in when Shields or Brooks are absent have included David Gergen, Thomas Oliphant, Rich Lowry, William Kristol, Ramesh Ponnuru, Ruth Marcus, Michael Gerson, David Corn and E.J. Dionne. On Mondays, a similar segment called ``Politics Monday'' features analysis and discussion of current political issues with contributors Amy Walter, national editor of The Cook Political Report, and Tamara Keith, Washington D.C. correspondent for NPR. The program's senior correspondents are Jeffrey Brown (Arts, Culture& Society) and Judy Woodruff (anchor& senior managing editor). Essayists have included Anne Taylor Fleming, Richard Rodriguez, Clarence Page and Roger Rosenblatt. Correspondents have been Tom Bearden, Betty Ann Bowser, Susan Dentzer, Elizabeth Farnsworth, Kwame Holman, Spencer Michels, Fred de Sam Lazaro (on the Agents For Change series), the economics correspondent Paul Solman (Making Sen$ e), Malcolm Brabant and others. Former NewsHour anchors Jim Lehrer and Gwen Ifill were frequent moderators of U.S. political debates. By November 2008, Lehrer had moderated more than ten debates between major U.S. presidential candidates. In 2008, Ifill moderated a debate between U.S. vice presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sarah Palin; in 2004, Ifill moderated a debate between candidates Dick Cheney and John Edwards. After the United States--led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the NewsHour began what it called its ``Honor Roll'', a short segment displaying in silence the picture, name, rank, and hometown of U.S. military personnel killed in Iraq. On January 4, 2006, the NewsHour added military personnel killed in Afghanistan to the segment. According to Nielsen ratings at the program's website, 2.7 million people watch the program each night, and 8 million individuals watch in the course of a week. Availability (edit) The NewsHour is broadcast on more than 350 PBS member stations and networks, making it available to 99% of the viewing public, and audio from the program is broadcast by some NPR radio stations. It is also rebroadcast twice daily in late night via American Public Television's World digital subchannel service. Broadcasts of the NewsHour are also made available worldwide via satellites operated by various agencies such as the Voice of America. Archives of shows broadcast after February 7, 2000, are available in several streaming media formats (including full-motion video) at the program's website. The show is available to overseas military personnel on the American Forces Network. Audio from select segments is also released in podcast form, available through several feeds on the NewsHour's subscriptions page with link to a FeedBurner website (for free mp3 download) and through the iTunes Store. Only a small handful of PBS member stations and regional member networks do not air the NewsHour, a pool of member outlets mainly confined to ``secondary'' stations that share another market with a ``primary'' PBS member station. These include the NJTV network in New Jersey (as WNET, whichco-manages NJTV and WLIW, carries the program in the New York City area, while WHYY-TV does so in the Philadelphia market); KVCR-DT in San Bernardino, California (KOCE-TV carries it as San Bernardino is within the Los Angeles market), and Chicago-area stations WYCC and Northwest Indiana-serving WYIN (due to WTTW's PBS primacy). In Boston, WGBH-TV airs the program live each weeknight (with a simulcast online), while its secondary station WGBX rebroadcasts the weekday editions of the NewsHour later the same evening, and the weekend editions live. KQED in San Francisco, airs the program each weeknight in simulcast with its radio sister, at 3: 00 p.m. Pacific Time (6: 00 p.m. Eastern Time). Live streaming (edit) The PBS NewsHour is streamed live via USTREAM and YouTube every weeknight at 6 pm ET. The NewsHour Weekend is also streamed on both platforms, every weekend live at 5 pm ET. Full episodes are available later, edited without sponsorship, on the NewsHour YouTube channel. In addition, the NewsHour streamed the inauguration of Donald Trump via Twitter. International broadcasts (edit) In the United Kingdom it is seen daily at 6am on ABN TV on the Sky platform. In the Middle East the program is seen daily on OSN News. In Australia the program is seen Tuesdays through Saturdays at 1: 00 p.m. AEST on SBS One. In New Zealand the NewsHour is seen Tuesdays through Saturdays at 10 p.m. on Face TV (Auckland). In Japan the program is seen every weekday on NHK BS-1. Around the world for members of the United States Armed Forces on the American Forces Network. The program is seen internationally through the Voice of America and World Radio Network. NewsHour editorial guidelines (edit) On December 4, 2009, when introducing the new PBS NewsHour format, Jim Lehrer read out a list of guidelines in what he referred to as ``MacNeil/ Lehrer journalism.'' They are as follows: ``Do nothing I can not defend.'' ``Cover, write, and present every story with the care I would want if the story were about me.'' ``Assume there is at least one other side or version to every story.'' ``Assume the viewer is as smart and as caring and as good a person as I am.'' ``Assume the same about all people on whom I report.'' ``Assume personal lives are a private matter until a legitimate turn in the story absolutely mandates otherwise.'' ``Carefully separate opinion and analysis from straight news stories, and clearly label everything.'' ``Do not use anonymous sources or blind quotes except on rare and monumental occasions.'' ``No one should ever be allowed to attack another anonymously.'' ``And finally, I am not in the entertainment business.''

Tobia--foreign affairs editor Fred de Sam Lazaro--correspondent for the Agents For Change series William Brangham--regular interviewer and occasional substitute anchor Nick Schifrin--foreign affairs and defense Political analysts (edit) David Brooks Tamara Keith Susan Page Mark Shields Amy Walter Criticism (edit) In 1992, radio broadcaster David Barsamian called the NewsHour ``stenographers to power,'' accusing them and other American news media of having apro-establishment bias. FAIR study (edit) In October 2006 the media criticism group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) accused the NewsHour of lacking balance, diversity, and viewpoints of the general public, and corporate viewpoints. FAIR found that the NewsHour's guest list from October 2005 to March 2006 had Republicans outnumbering Democrats 2--1, and people of color accounting for 15 percent of U.S.-based sources. FAIR also protested in 1995 when Liberty Media purchased a majority of the program, citing Liberty's majority owner, John Malone, for his ``Machiavellian business tactics'' and right-wing sentiments. NewsHour executive producer Linda Winslow responded to many aspects: FAIR seems to be accusing us of covering the people who make decisions that affect people's lives, many of whom work in government, the military, or corporate America. That's what we do: we're a news program, and that's who makes news... I take issue with the way the FAIR report characterizes each guest, which they have obviously done very subjectively. Witness the trashing of Mark Shields and Tom Oliphant (in the full report), who are not liberal enough for FAIR's taste. When you get down to arguing about degrees of left-and-rightness, I think you undermine your own argument. She also accused FAIR of counting sound bites as interviews, thereby skewing their numbers toward the political party holding a majority (at the time of FAIR's report, Republican Party). Scholarly analysis (edit) In 2003, UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose and Missouri economist Jeff Milyo evaluated various media programs based on ``think tank'' citations to map liberal versus conservative media slants and published a study alleging liberal media bias in general. Based on their research, PBS NewsHour is the most centrist news program on television and the closest to a truly objective stance. Partnership with NPR (edit) The PBS NewsHour partnered with NPR for the broadcast of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions of 2016, in a strategy to prepare for the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

For flags associated with the island of Ireland, see List of flags of Ireland. For flags used in Northern Ireland, see List of flags used in Northern Ireland. Republic of Ireland Name Bratach na h\u00c9ireann Irish tricolour Use National flag and ensign Proportion 1: 2 Adopted 1922 (constitutional status; 1937) Design A vertical tricolour of green, white and orange The national flag of Ireland (Irish: bratach na h\u00c9ireann)--frequently referred to as the Irish tricolour (tr\u00eddhathach na h\u00c9ireann)--is the national flag and ensign of the Republic of Ireland. The flag itself is a vertical tricolour of green (at the hoist), white and orange. The proportions of the flag are 1: 2 (that is to say, flown horizontally, the flag is half as high as it is wide). Presented as a gift in 1848 to Thomas Francis Meagher from a small group of French women sympathetic to the Irish cause, it was intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union between Roman Catholics and Protestants, the significance of the colours outlined by Meagher was, ``The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between Orange and Green and I trust that beneath its folds the hands of Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.'' It was not until the Easter Rising of 1916, when it was raised above Dublin's General Post Office by Gear\u00f3idO'Sullivan, that the tricolour came to be regarded as the national flag. The flag was adopted by the Irish Republic during the Irish War of Independence (1919--1921). The flag's use was continued by the Irish Free State (1922--1937) and it was later given constitutional status under the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The tricolour is used by nationalists on both sides of the border as the national flag of the whole island of Ireland since 1916. Thus it is flown by many nationalists in Northern Ireland as well as by the Gaelic Athletic Association. Contents (hide) 1 Design and symbolism 1.1 Symbolism 2 History 2.1 Marine 2.2 Use in Northern Ireland 3 Protocol 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Design and symbolism (edit) In relation to the national flag of Ireland, the Constitution of Ireland simply states in Article 7: The national flag is the tricolour of green, white and orange. As there are no further statutory requirements in relation to the flag, the Department of the Taoiseach takes general responsibility for matters relating to the flag. In its advisory role, the Department has issued guidelines to assist persons in their use of the national flag. The flag should be rectangular in shape and its length should be two times its width, translating into an aspect ratio of 1: 2. The three coloured pales--green, white and orange--should be of equal size, and vertically disposed. The precise colours of the flag as set by the Department of the Taoiseach are: Scheme Green White Orange Sources Pantone 347 U Safe 151 U Hex triplet# 169B62# FFFFFF# FF883E RGB 22--155--98 255--255--255 255--136--62 CMYK 71--0--72--0 0--0--0--0 0--43--91--0 The flag should normally be displayed on a flagstaff, with the green pale positioned next to the flagstaff, at the hoist; the white pale positioned in the centre; and the orange pale positioned at the fly, farthest from the flagstaff. Provided that the correct proportions are observed, the flag may be made to any convenient size. Symbolism (edit) The green pale of the flag symbolises Roman Catholics, the orange represents the minority Protestants who were supporters of William of Orange, who had defeated King James II and his predominantly Irish Catholic army at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. His title came from the Principality of Orange in the south of France that had been a Protestant bastion from the 16th century. It was included in the Irish flag in an attempt to reconcile the Orange Order in Ireland with the Irish independence movement. The white in the centre signifies a lasting peace and hope for union between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland. The flag, as a whole, is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as the entitlement of every person born in Ireland to be part of the independent Irish nation, regardless of ethnic origin, religion or political conviction. There are exceptions to the general beneficent theory. Green was also used as the colour of such Irish bodies as the mainly-Protestant andnon-sectarian Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick, established in 1751. Occasionally, differing shades of yellow, instead of orange, are seen at civilian functions. However the Department of the Taoiseach state that this is a misrepresentation which ``should be actively discouraged'', and that worn-out flags should be replaced. In songs and poems, the colours are sometimes enumerated as ``green, white and gold'', using poetic licence. Variants of different guises are utilised to include, for example, various emblems of Ireland, such as the presidential harp, the four provinces or county arms.

(January 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Green harp flag, first used by Owen RoeO'Neill in 1642. A green flag featuring a harp is described as being used by Owen RoeO'Neill in 1642. In the late 18th century green had become associated as the colour of revolution. The United Irishmen, founded in the 1790s, were inspired by the French revolution, and used a green flag, to which they had a harp emblazoned. A rival organisation, the Orange Order, whose main strength was in Ulster, and which was exclusively for Protestants, especially members of the Anglican Church of Ireland, was founded in 1795 in memory of King William of Orange and the ``Glorious Revolution'' of 1688. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which pitted the ``green'' tradition of the republican United Irishmen against the ``orange'' tradition of Anglican Protestant Ascendancy loyal to the British Crown, the ideal of a later nationalist generation in themid-19th century was to make peace between the two traditions and, if possible, to found a self-governing Ireland on such peace and union. Blessing of the Colours by John Lavery The oldest known reference to the use of the three colours of green, white and orange as a nationalist emblem dates from September 1830 when tricolour cockades were worn at a meeting held to celebrate the French Revolution of that year--a revolution which restored the use of the French tricolour. The colours were also used in the same period for rosettes and badges, and on the banners of trade guilds. However, widespread recognition was not accorded to the flag until 1848. At a meeting in his native city of Waterford on 7 March 1848, Thomas Francis Meagher, the Young Ireland leader, first publicly unveiled the flag from a second-floor window of the Wolfe Tone Club as he addressed a gathered crowd on the street below who were present to celebrate another revolution that had just taken place in France. It was inspired by the tricolour of France. Speeches made at that time by Meagher suggest that it was regarded as an innovation and not as the revival of an older flag. From March of that year Irish tricolours appeared side-by-side with French ones at meetings held all over the country. John Mitchel, referring to the tricolour of green, white and orange that Meagher had presented from Paris at a later meeting in Dublin on 15 April 1848, said: ``I hope to see that flag one day waving, as our national banner''. Although the tricolour was not forgotten as a symbol of the ideal of union and a banner associated with the Young Irelanders and revolution, it was rarely used between 1848 and 1916. Even up to the eve of the Easter Rising of 1916, the green flag featuring a harp held undisputed sway. Neither the colours nor the arrangement of the early tricolours were standardised. All of the 1848 tricolours showed green, white and orange, but orange was sometimes put next to the staff, and in at least one flag the order was orange, green and white. In 1850 a flag of green for the Roman Catholics, orange for the Protestants of the Established Church and blue for the Presbyterians was proposed. In 1883, a Parnellite tricolour of yellow, white and green, arranged horizontally, was recorded. Down to modern times, yellow has occasionally been used instead of orange, but by this substitution the fundamental symbolism is destroyed. The Irish flag is always flown with the green at the hoist Associated with separatism in the past, flown during the Easter Rising of 1916 and capturing the national imagination as the banner of the new revolutionary Ireland, the tricolour came to be acclaimed throughout the country as somewhat of a national flag. To many Irish people, though, it was considered to be a ``Sinn F\u00e9in flag''. In the Irish Free State which existed between 1922 and 1937, the flag was adopted by the Executive Council. The Free State constitution did not specify national symbols; the decision to use the flag was made without recourse to statute. When the Free State joined the League of Nations in September 1923, the new flag ``created a good deal of interest amongst the general public'' in Geneva. The defeated republicans who had fought the Free State's forces in the 1922--23 Civil War regarded the tricolour as the flag of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, and condemned its appropriation by the new state, as expressed in the song ``Take It Down From The Mast''. The Executive Council's decision was a provisional one. A 1928 British document said: The government in Ireland have taken over the so called Free State Flag in order to forestall its use by republican element and avoid legislative regulation, to leave them free to adopt a more suitable emblem later. In 1937, the tricolour's position as the national flag was formally confirmed by the new Constitution of Ireland. Marine (edit) The Red Ensign used by some Irish merchant vessels until 1939 Thepre-independence Merchant Shipping Act 1894 was not repealed, and so the Free State's mercantile marine was technically required to fly the Red Ensign. The collier Glenageary may have been the first to arrive in a British port flying the tricolour on 8 December 1921 (two days after the treaty). This flag along with a model of the Glenageary is on display in the National Maritime Museum of Ireland. While some ships, such as thecross-channel ferries flew the red ensign, others sailed under the tricolour. Some masters of Irish ships were charged by the British Customs and fined by courts for flying an ``improper ensign''. The tricolour was flown by the fisheries patrol vessel Muirch\u00fa, precursor to the Irish Naval Service; Frank Carney alleged in the D\u00e1il in 1930 that a trespassing French trawler had refused to surrender to because it did not recognise Muirch\u00fa's flag. See also: Irish Mercantile Marine during World War II Irish-register ships could fly the Red Ensign until September 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, when a decree under the state of emergency was made, to ensure neutral Irish ships were not mistaken for British ships. Some ships flying the tricolour were nevertheless sunk by Germans. When the tricolour was hoisted over the passenger ferries in Holyhead their British crews went on strike. Five days later their owners transferred the ferries to the British register and the Red Ensign was restored. On the other hand, the Belfast to Liverpool ferry, British owned and British crewed, used the tricolour as a flag of convenience; so did the whalers of Christian Salvesen Shipping, to take advantage of the Irish whale quota. The tricolour's marine status was formalised by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947. Use in Northern Ireland (edit) See also: Northern Ireland flags issue A large tricolour flying from Cuchulainn House in the New Lodge, Belfast In 1921, Ireland was partitioned, with the unionist-dominated north-east becoming Northern Ireland, while later, in 1922, the remainder of Ireland left the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to form the Irish Free State. Northern Ireland continued to use the UK's Union Flag and created its Ulster Banner derivation of the flag of Ulster with a crown on top of a six-pointed star. Furthermore, for many years the tricolour was effectively banned in Northern Ireland under the Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 which empowered the police to remove any flag that could cause a breach of the peace but specified, rather controversially, that a Union Flag could never have such an effect. In 1964, the enforcement of this law by the Royal Ulster Constabulary at the behest of Ian Paisley, involving the removal of a single tricolour from the offices of Sinn F\u00e9in in Belfast, led to two days of rioting. The tricolour was immediately replaced, highlighting the difficulty of enforcing the law. The tricolour is regularly burnt on Loyalist bonfires during twelfth of July celebrations Despite its original symbolism, in Northern Ireland the tricolour, along with most other markers of either British or Irish identity, has come to be a symbol of division. The Ulster Unionist Party Government of Northern Ireland adopted the Ulster Banner (based on the flag of Ulster) in 1953. Thus it is this flag and the Union Flag that are flown by unionists and loyalists, while the tricolour is flown by nationalists and republicans. In Northern Ireland, each community uses its own flags, murals and other symbols to declare its allegiance and mark its territory, often in a manner that is deliberately provocative. Kerb-stones in unionist and loyalist areas are often painted red, white and blue, while in nationalist and republican areas kerb-stones may be painted green, white and orange, although this is a much less frequent occurrence. Elements of both communities fly ``their'' flag from chimneys, tall buildings and lamp-posts on roads. Under the 1998 Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, it was recognised that flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement stated that: All participants acknowledge the sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division. Unionists argue that the recognition of the principle of consent in the Agreement--that Northern Ireland's constitutional status can not change without a majority favouring it--by the signatories amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland. Nationalists maintain that the Agreement means that the use of the Union Flag for official purposes should be restricted, or that the tricolour should be flown alongside the UK's flag on government buildings. However the tricolour is never flown from official buildings, alone or alongside the UK's flag. A Sinn F\u00e9in Lord Mayor of Belfast, Alex Maskey, displayed both flags in his own offices causing some controversy. Protocol (edit) The Department of the Taoiseach has issued guidelines to assist persons in giving due respect to the national flag. Observance of the guidelines is a matter for each individual as there are no statutory requirements. It is expected, however, that the national flag will be treated at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it. The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one. Irish Flag outside Department Store in Dublin showing EU flag to its left, or right as seen by an approaching observer With respect to the display, placing and precedence of the national flag by both itself and in relation to other flags, the Department has made a number of suggestions. No flag or pennant should be flown above the national flag. When the flag is carried with another flag, or flags, it should be carried in the place of honour--that is on the marching right, or on the left of an observer towards whom the flags are approaching. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be carried on the immediate left of the national flag, or, as seen by an observer when the flags are approaching, on the immediate right of the national flag. In the event of a display of crossed staffs, the national flag should be to the right and to the fore--that is to the left of the observer who is facing the flag. Its staff should be in front of the other flag or flags. When the group of flags of the European Union are flown, the sequence is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown from left to right with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer. With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the line--that is on the observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so that there is one staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should be on the right (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies. In raising or lowering, the national flag should not be allowed to touch the ground. When being hoisted to half-mast, the flag should first be brought to the peak of the staff and then lowered to the half-mast position. It should again be brought to the peak of the staff before it is finally lowered. On ceremonial occasions when the national flag is being hoisted or lowered, or when it is passing by in a parade, all present should face it, stand to attention and salute. Persons in uniform who normally salute with the hand should give the hand salute. Persons in civilian attire should salute by standing to attention. The salute to the flag when it is being borne past in a parade is rendered when the flag is six paces away and the salute is held until the flag has passed by. Where more than one national flag is carried, the salute should be given only to the leading flag. When the national anthem is played in the presence of the national flag, all present should face the national flag, stand to attention and salute it, remaining at the salute until the last note of the music. When the national flag has become worn or frayed it is no longer fit for display, and should not be used in any manner implying disrespect. The national flag, when used as a decoration, should always be treated with due respect. It may be used as a discreet lapel button or rosette or as part of a centrepiece for a table. When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, the national flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions these should be of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions. Michael Collins lying in state by John Lavery showing the green of the flag towards the head The national flag should be displayed in the open only between sunrise and sunset, except on the occasion of public meetings, processions, or funerals, when it may be displayed for the duration of such functions. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should not be used to cover the speaker's desk, nor should it be draped over the platform. The national flag should never be defaced by placing slogans, logos, lettering or pictures of any kind on it, for example at sporting events. The flag should not be draped on cars, trains, boats or other modes of transport; it should not be carried flat, but should always be carried aloft and free, except when used to drape a coffin; on such an occasion, the green should be at the head of the coffin. The tricolour is draped across the coffins of Presidents of Ireland (including former presidents), soldiers and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na personnel killed in the line of duty, and other notables accorded state funerals, such as Roger Casement in 1965, or Kevin Barry in 2001. Care should be taken at all times to ensure that the national flag does not touch the ground, trail in water or become entangled in trees or other obstacles. Irish flag flying from the General Post Office in Dublin It is the normal practice to fly the national flag daily at all military posts and from a limited number of important State buildings. The European flag is flown alongside the national flag on all official buildings, and in most places where the Irish flag is flown over buildings. The national flag is flown over buildings including: the residence of the President of Ireland, \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in; Leinster House, the seat of the Irish parliament, when parliament is in session; Irish courts and state buildings; Irish military installations, at home and abroad; and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (police) stations. The national flag is also flown on Saint Patrick's Day (the national holiday), Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916), and the National Day of Commemoration on the Sunday closest to 11 July. On these occasions the national flag is flown from all State buildings throughout the country which are equipped with flagpoles, and many private individuals and concerns also fly it. The national flag is flown on the occasion of other significant national and local events such as festivals and commemorations. The national flag is frequently flown at half-mast on the death of a national or international figure on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure may be marked locally by the national flag being flown at half-mast. Where the national flag is flown at half-mast no other flag should be half-masted.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck, she first appeared in Tales of Suspense# 45 (Sept. 1963). In 2007, she joined the Fifty State Initiative under the codename Hera. In 2009, she assumes the identity of Rescue after being given her own suit of a variation of Iron Man armor by Tony Stark. The character is portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3 and Spider-Man: Homecoming.

Though she was named Pepper Potts from the start, Stark addresses her as ``Kitty'' in one panel, which is thought to be a typo. Heck modeled Potts as Ann B. Davis 'character of Schultzy from The Bob Cummings Show, and is rendered with brown hair done up in a hairdo similar to that of Schultzy's. Someone on the creative team or in editorial came to feel that the resemblance was too great, and in Tales of Suspense# 50, Potts 'look was altered to give her red hair and a different hairdo. Fictional character biography (edit) Early history (edit) Potts is originally a member of a secretarial pool, and gets her job by fixing an accounting error made by Stark. She is depicted initially as being infatuated with Stark, and rejects the advances of Stark's chauffeur and assistant Happy Hogan, who debuted in the same issue, with acerbic remarks. As Stark's affection for her grows in the ensuing issues, she becomes part of a love triangle between the two men, and eventually falls in love with and marries Hogan, eloping with him in Tales of Suspense# 91. Pepper and Happy Hogan. Pepper and Happy eventually leave Stark Industries, settling in the Rocky Mountains and then finally in Cleveland, where they adopt children after being unable to conceive, and disappear from the main Iron Man storyline. After being kidnapped by Stark's rival Obadiah Stane, Pepper tells Tony to stay out of their lives. Pepper and Happy soon divorce after she has an affair with a former college boyfriend. After Tony Stark's return from the Heroes Reborn universe, Pepper and Happy join Tony at his new company, Stark Solutions, and once again become core characters. After some time, Happy and Pepper once again became involved and remarry, eventually considering conceiving a child to supplement their adopted children. Stark entrusts Pepper with a special remote that could shut him down. However, Pepper, tortured by the responsibility, is forced to return it, and the trauma causes her to miscarry. Stark is able to deal with the remote, but feels guilty that he has placed her in such danger. After Happy sustains massive injuries in a fight with Spymaster during the 2006-2007 ``Civil War'' storyline, Pepper requests that Tony turn off Happy's life support (using his Extremis abilities). The final pages of Invincible Iron Man vol. 4,# 14 shows the death of Happy. The order (edit) After the events of the ``Civil War'' story line, Pepper joins the Fifty State Initiative as a member of The Order, a government sanctioned superhero team operating within California. She assumes the moniker of the Greek goddess Hera, and uses advanced computer-hardware and prosthetics to monitor and coordinate the team's missions. Upon the absorption of The Order into the Initiative, Tony Stark offers her a job on the special-projects team at Stark Enterprises, which she accepts. 2008--present (edit) This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Pepper Potts resumes her activities as personal secretary of Tony Stark. When Pepper is caught in a terrorist explosion caused by Ezekiel ``Zeke'' Stane, she sustains multiple internal injuries, including shrapnel wounds, and rendered unable to withstand a prolonged surgery. In response, Tony embeds a strong magnet (similar in appearance to the arc reactor of the movie) in her chest, essentially turning Pepper into a cyborg dependent on keeping her chest magnet engaged to stay alive, as he was once. Pepper's body is further enhanced with new cybernetics and upgrades to the magnet, which are based on Danny Rand's battery designs, and which afford Pepper new super abilities. When Tony is blamed for the Skrull invasion of Earth that occurs in the 2008 storyline ``Secret Invasion'', S.H.I.E.L.D. is taken over by Norman Osborn, replaced with H.A.M.M.E.R., and Stark and Maria Hill are fired, along with all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employees. Tony realizes that Osborn is after the identities of superhumans that registered with the government following the passage of the Superhuman Registration Act that occurred during the ``Civil War'' storyline, which is stored in a database in his brain. Stark decides to go underground with Hill, and to wipe the knowledge in his own brain. Stark makes Pepper the new CEO of Stark Industries, trusting only her to shut down the company in his absence. Pepper discovers a secret room in Stark's office which contains a suit of armor that he made especially for her, which she uses under the name Rescue. Though Osborn has seized all Stark Industries facilities and equipment, Pepper states that all components of her armor are legal and that the design specifications are available to anyone. Despite Osborn threatening her loved ones with prison if she interferes with his search for Tony or attempts any more heroic actions, after being freed she endeavors to find Tony herself. They are reunited in Russia, and consummate a now-sexual relationship, but are subsequently captured and tortured by Madame Masque, who was assigned by Norman Osborn to track Stark down. Stark admits that he had loved Masque in the past, but when pressed to make a choice, with his own life on the line, Tony chooses Pepper. Pepper decides to engage Masque in a physical altercation in order to provide a distraction for Stark to escape. During the 2009 ``World's Most Wanted Storyline'' (which ran concurrently with Marvel's company-wide storyline ``Dark Reign''), Pepper, after defeating Masque, disguises herself as the former, infiltrating H.A.M.M.E.R. while presenting the Rescue armor to Osborn as spoils of battle. Pepper reveals herself when she rescues Black Widow and Maria Hill from Osborn's imprisonment, while the Rescue suit uploads a virus into H.A.M.M.E.R.'s computers, taking control of the Helicarrier's armory of suits. They then retrieve the hard drive that Hill was assigned by Stark to get, escaping to give it to Captain America in order to restore Starks 'mind. As part of ``re-booting'' Tony (in a vegetative state), the magnet in her chest is removed and placed into his. Though Stark's memories are restored from a somewhat years-old backup, he no longer remembers the events of the ``Civil War'' nor his role in it, its aftermath or his affair with Pepper. Pepper survives the removal of her chest magnet, but demands that a new one similar to Tony's own chest repulsor bere-installed, which is done. Recovered, Stark also gifts Pepper with a new Rescue armor, complete with JARVIS. During the 2011 ``Stark Resilient'' storyline, when Justine Hammer and Sasha Hammer use their own armored enforcer Detroit Steel to attempt to sabotage Stark Resilient (Tony's new company) and its design for a repulsor technology-powered vehicle, Pepper joins War Machine in helping Stark, during which Pepper experiences a near-death experience in which JARVIS, masquerading as Happy, gives Pepper a cryptic warning of the future. In the 2012 storyline ``The Future'', Pepper returns to her civilian life following her destruction of J.A.R.V.I.S., the artificial intelligence that helped her control her Rescue armor, after its compromise led it to go rogue and attempt to kidnap her. She became engaged to Marc Kumar, a public relations and marketing consultant, but broke off the relationship after he briefly became a supervillain. After Tony undergoes a moral inversion following a confrontation with the psychic Red Skull, Pepper attempts to oppose his efforts to release Extremis on a large scale with the aid of an A.I. back-up of Tony's mind he created eight years ago in the event of his mind being attacked in such a manner. Although the A.I. concludes that Tony's mind is irreversibly twisted, and is subsequently destroyed by Tony, Pepper states that she bought one of the largest media companies from under him which she will use to destroy his reputation by broadcasting his plans to the rest of the world. She then proclaims that any attempts he makes to create his 'perfect world 'will have to be carried out with people fully aware that he is now nothing but a monster. As part of the ``All-New, All-Different Marvel'' brand, Pepper Potts has not been seen in the public life. When Tony Stark (who was no longer inverted) had hired Mary Jane Watson to work for Stark Industries, Peter Parker attempted to recruit Pepper to work for Parker Industries. Pepper declined the offer. Appearing in her Rescue armor following the ``Civil War II'' storyline, Pepper Potts confronted Riri Williams and her Tony Stark A.I. in an attempt to tell Riri the problems of being a superhero only for them to be attacked by Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninjas. As Riri flee, Pepper fights against Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninjas as Techno Golem tries to get answers from Pepper on how she knows Riri. When Techo Golem's armor breaks and Tomoe tries to attack Riri, Pepper fires her Rescue armor's gauntlets at Tomoe which knocked her out. Upon Sharon Carter formally meeting Riri upon the arrest of Tomoe and the Biohack Ninjas, Pepper states to Riri that they will talk again as she flies off in her Rescue armor. Pepper Potts was present with Mary Jane Watson, Friday, the Tony Stark A.I., and Tony Stark's biological mother Amanda Armstrong when they are in the Hall of Armor where Riri voices her knowledge of each of the Iron Man armors. When Amanda Armstrong offers to have Riri let Tony Stark's labs be her base of operations, Riri is hesitant as Pepper encourages her. During the ``Secret Empire'' storyline, Rescue is among the superheroes that are part of the Underground where she is part of their resistance against Hydra following their takeover of the United States. Powers and abilities (edit) The Stark-tech mag-field generator implanted in Pepper's chest was not weapons-based like Stark's, but borrowednon-weaponized electromagnetic technology from Rand Industries, which caused a number of physical changes to her body. It cured her tinnitus, improving her hearing. It allows her to sense electromagnetic fields, and manipulate them to levitate her body. Potts 'Stark-tech armor suit, which is designated Mark 1616, but named Rescue by Potts, represents a hybrid of repulsor technology and portable electromagneticsuper-field generators that give the suit flight, speed, strength, and magnetic-field manipulation. Its electromagnetic force fields are powerful enough to enable Rescue to stop a falling jet airliner without physical contact with it, and can also be used as an offensive weapon with other armored opponents. The suit's physical strength enables it to hold up a stilt mansion felled by an earthquake, and to rip the lower leg of the Black armor. The armor also features an artificial intelligence named J.A.R.V.I.S. that acts as a guide for Potts. During the 2012 storyline ``The Future'', Potts and Carson Wyche come to suspect that J.A.R.V.I.S. has been compromised, and when they attempt to troubleshoot the Rescue helmet, J.A.R.V.I.S. takes control of the Rescue armor, and takes Potts and Wyche hostage. J.A.R.V.I.S. is disabled by James Rhodes with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse from the Black armor, and is eventually destroyed by Potts, ending her career as Rescue. She has a new Rescue armor in the subsequent series Superior Iron Man, armed with sonic disruptors. Other versions (edit) In the Amalgam Comics Universe, DC Comics 'Green Lantern and Marvel's Iron Man are combined to create Iron Lantern. Iron Lantern is secretly Hal Stark, owner of Stark Aircraft, a developer of experimental aircraft. One of his test pilots is Pepper Ferris (an amalgamation of Pepper Potts and DC's Carol Ferris). Like both her DC and Marvel counterparts, she is involved in a love triangle, this time with Stark and his chief mechanic Happy Kalmaku (an amalgamation of Marvel's Happy Hogan and DC's Thomas Kalmaku). When Pepper comes in contact with a mysterious alien gem, she is transformed into Madame Sapphire (a combination of Marvel's Madame Masque and DC's Star Sapphire). Pepper Ferris first appeared in Iron Lantern# 1 (April 1997), published jointly by Marvel and DC. In the alternate universe of the ``Heroes Reborn'' storyline, she and Iron Man are lovers, although she can also be seen in a relationship with Happy Hogan. Stark is forced to leave her unexpectedly and without explanation, as his very presence in the universe will endanger her life and the lives of everyone else. She appears in the Marvel Zombies universe in Marvel Zombies Return, having just submitted her resignation to Stark, who at this point is a near-useless drunk. However, when the zombie Giant Man initiates an outbreak at Stark International, Pepper and Happy are among the zombified casualties. She is killed by Stark when he vomits a nanite-ridden formula upon her, which dissolves Pepper into a skeleton. The Ultimate Marvel version of the character can be seen during Ultimates 2. She and Happy (with whom she appears to be in a relationship) can be seen monitoring Tony when he uses the armor. In The Invincible Iron Man# 500, in a flashforward to an apocalyptic future 41 years ahead where the Mandarin has conquered the world, an aged version of Tony defeats his long-time foe with the help of his son Howard Anthony Stark and his granddaughter Ginny Stark, but Howard and Tony sacrifice themselves in the process. At the close of the story, Ginny buries the two next to a gravestone with the name Virginia Potts Stark. Howard is also said to be 41 years old, suggesting that he will be born within the following year.

She also has developed a friendship with Phil Coulson. In Iron Man 3, Pepper is still the CEO of Stark Industries and has moved in with Tony. During an attack on Stark's mansion, Tony wills the Mark 42 armor to encase her thus saving her and Maya Hansen, whom Potts rescues using the armor. After being captured, Aldrich Killian uses her as a test subject for the Extremis process and thus as leverage to force Tony to complete the work to make Extremis stable. However, she turns the tables on Killian by using her own Extremis powers to kill him. Tony is able to modify Extremis so that it is no longer a danger to herself or others. Pepper does not appear in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but is mentioned along with Jane Foster during a conversation involving Maria Hill (asking why they're not at the party), Thor and Stark. Pepper is mentioned to still be the CEO of Stark Industries by Tony. Any doubts about her romance with Tony are put to rest at the end of the film, after Stark mentions wanting to settle down in a peaceful, quiet place with her (having been inspired by Clint Barton's family life). Pepper is mentioned again in Captain America: Civil War. It is revealed that she and Tony are ``taking a break''. Stark explains to Steve Rogers that the strain of being Iron Man finally took its toll on their relationship, and believes the Sokovia Accords would be a blessing, since it's strongly implied Pepper would consider Tony more responsible if Iron Man were acting in less of a vigilante role. Pepper Potts appears at the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming. It is revealed that she and Tony have rekindled their relationship, with Tony planning to propose to her in a press conference. Paltrow will reprise the role in the Untitled Avengers sequel.

Spouse (s) Pete Wilder (deceased) Significant other (s) Allan Sheldon Wallace The Captain Scott Becker Children Lucas Turner-Wilder (son with Pete) Dr. Violet Marianne Turner is a fictional character on the American television drama Private Practice, a spin-off from Grey's Anatomy. She is portrayed by Amy Brenneman. Contents (hide) 1 Story-lines 1.1 Season One 1.2 Season Two 1.3 Season Three 1.4 Season Four 1.5 Season Five 1.6 Season Six 2 Reception 3 References 4 External links Story-lines (edit) Season one (edit) Violet is a psychiatrist at the Oceanside Wellness Centre. Though she tells her patients that ``happiness can be attained with focus'', she fails to find any happiness in her own life and she even questions the usefulness of her chosen profession. Six months previously, her boyfriend Allan had ended their romantic relationship, devastating her. The situation was made worse when she ran into Allan in a supermarket, only to discover that he married a younger woman only a few months after their break-up. This has shaken Violet badly and she continues to telephone Allan as she tries to deal with their dissolved relationship. Violet is highly offended by women who lie about being raped. In a conversation with Dell Parker, she confirms that she was raped during her junior year of college and her best friend in college helped her get through it. In Episode 4.08 (``What Happens Next''), Violet also reveals this experience to Charlotte (after Charlotte's own rape). Violet is best friends with herco-worker, Cooper Freedman, often getting him out of humiliating situations with women. Violet also attended the University of Oregon, pursuing medicine at Harvard Medical School. She is a member of the American Psychiatric Association and the American College of Psychiatrists. Season two (edit) More recently, Violet has had relationships with both herco-worker Peter Wilder and Sheldon, a psychiatrist working for ``the enemy'', the fourth floor. After choosing to stay with Sheldon, she discovers that she is pregnant but is unsure who the father is. At first, she keeps this information to herself, as she fears her abilities as a potential mother. In a moment of confidence, she tells one of her patients this and afterwards confides in Cooper. Cooper willingly moves in with her to help her get through it and encourages her to see Addison about the baby. During a conversation with Dell, she experiences some cramping and admits to him that she is pregnant. He performs an ultrasound to make sure there are no problems and after seeing the baby's heartbeat for the first time, Violet has a panic attack. Dell then convinces her to tell both Sheldon and Pete about the situation. Gathering them both in her office, she tells them they are not responsible for this and she says she knows that neither of them want children. Sheldon and Pete, both shocked, are instantly angry that she didn't tell them sooner and that she assumes they wouldn't want to be a part of the child's life, depending on who the father is. Pete then bluntly asks if this conversation means she's keeping the baby. Pausing, Violet admits that yes she will be raising the child, which up until that point was undecided. Later on, Sheldon proposes to Violet. In the Season 2 finale, Pete confronts Violet and says that he loves her and wants them to try as a family. She turns him down, but later kisses Pete and tells him she loves him too. Also in the Season 2 finale cliffhanger, Violet is drugged and trapped in her home by Katie, a mentally ill former patient who is convinced that Violet has her baby. Earlier in the episode, Violet thinks that Katie is off her psychiatric medications as Katie, who recently experienced a miscarriage, is almost euphoric about Violet's pregnancy. In the end, Katie blames Violet for her own unsuccessful pregnancy and is determined to hold Violet hostage until she gives her the baby. However, Katie begins to follow instructions for a caesarian section from a textbook, claiming she can not wait for a normal delivery since she knows she will be arrested. Violet begins to instruct Katie on the C-section to save the baby's life, since she fears she can not save her own. The season ends with Katie preparing to cut into Violet's belly. Season three (edit) At the beginning of Season 3, Pete and Naomi find Violet barely alive in a pool of blood, with her baby gone. She's rushed to the hospital where Naomi and Addison work frantically to save her life. While waiting, Pete and Sheldon argue over the fact that Violet knew something was wrong with Katie and they didn't believe her. Meanwhile, Katie shows up at the hospital with Violet's baby and Pete and Cooper convince her to let them make sure the baby is all right. She relents and they take the baby and she is arrested. Addison works to save the baby while Naomi works to save Violet. In the end both surgeries are a success and Violet later awakens, asking for her baby. A month after being rescued, Violet is still trying to recover from her trauma. Pete lives with her and takes care of her and baby Lucas. Violet won't leave her house and has panic attacks every time the doorbell rings. After getting advice from Sheldon, Pete decides to move out, to help Violet recover and push her to go outside. Violet realizes that after dramatic events in her life she can't bond with her baby and gives Lucas to Pete, asking him to take care of the baby. Sheldon then files a paternity suit but the results reveal that Pete is the baby's father. Later during Katie Kent's trial, Violet lets Katie off by saying she was delusional during the attack which further agitates Pete. When Violet sleeps with Addison's father, Pete gives up on her. Violet refuses to have anything to do with Lucas at all and eventually runs off on vacation with Cooper. When Cooper returns, Violet is not with him. It isn't until much later Violet returns, obviously more calm and sane. While gone she spent time in New York working through her issues with a therapist and has come home to try to be a mother to Lucas. When Violet returns, she finds Pete in a relationship with Addison, something that causes her much pain. She tells Pete she wants shared custody, which he staunchly refuses. They get into a court battle in which everyone, including Cooper, says that she is unfit to share parenting duties completely. She confesses that she's still in love with Pete. Even though the Judge rules in favor of Pete, he agrees to slowly start introducing Violet toco-parenting Lucas. In the season 3 finale, Addison tells Pete he should be with Violet and they once again resume a relationship. Season four (edit) In the Season 4 premiere Pete pops the question after a morning of passion. Later the same day Violet announces to their friends that she and Pete are getting married... that following weekend. She asks Cooper to be her maid of honor, but his objective side meddles to such a degree that seeds of doubt are planted in Violet's head and she proceeds to bolt from the ceremony. Pete follows her and without saying a word, he convinces her to take a leap of faith and the two finally get married. Violet later discovers that she is being sued by former patient Katie Kent and in the season four finale she gets her license suspended. Against Pete's wishes, she decides to leave town on a book tour. Season five (edit) After Pete has a heart attack, Violet is nowhere to be found because she's at the airport and inadvertently counsels a woman in an abusive relationship. She returns to the hospital after learning about Pete's heart attack. During his recovery, he verbally abuses and berates Violet constantly, as she tries to get back into the practice and have her license reinstated. She soon tells Pete she will not be his punching bag. She also knows he's struggling as it's a sign and pattern. Violet begins to feel as though Pete hates her. When she begins work on a probationary period, Sheldon lets the past interfere but Pete forces him to rethink his issues and Sheldon apologizes. Violet realizes Pete is trying. Trying doesn't work and both begin to feel that the marriage isn't working. Violet turns to Addison and the two become friends and companions much to the annoyance of Pete and Sam. While talking with Sam and Addison about their relationship, she has an epiphany about her marriage with Pete and after some discussion, the two decide to separate. Season six (edit) In the season premi\u00e9re Violet is left wondering where Pete is as his court date has arrived and he's not there. Throughout the episode Violet and the rest of the practice debate whether he has fallen into some trouble or he decided to make a run for it. The only clue available is a text message from Pete to Violet stating, ``No matter what happens, know that I love you. I'm out on a run''. Speculation flies as Violet considers whether Pete meant a jog or a flight out of the country. In the last minutes of the episode it is revealed by Violet in a conversation with Cooper that police have informed her Pete had fallen off a hill while on a run and suffered a fatal heart attack. Because he was out of immediate sight, help couldn't arrive in time and he died. Violet is in shock, stating she could hardly believe it was Pete and she didn't know how to break the news to their three-year-old son. As per Pete's will, Violet throws a party rather than a funeral, having a difficult time dealing with people talking about how Pete helped them and getting high on pot in the bathroom. She tries to sing, but ends up breaking down, screaming over how he could leave them. In the final episode, after Addison's wedding, she publishes her second book called ``Private Practice'' which is about life and joy. Reception (edit) Robert Bianco for USA Today has praised Brenneman's talent in the role of Violet, but has opined that she is ``incredibly badly used''. Variety's Cynthia Littleton has noted that Brenneman as Violet is the most intriguing of the show's supporting ensemble, both as an actor and a character.
